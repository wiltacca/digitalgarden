The central theme of the Bible is the kingdom of God, which encompasses God's sovereign rule and his relationship with humanity. 

This theme is woven throughout Scripture in several key ways:

1. God's kingship and rule: The Bible portrays God as the supreme ruler and sovereign king over all creation[1][5].

2. Human beings as subjects: As God's creation made in his image, humans are meant to be subjects in God's kingdom, living under his rule and authority[1].

3. God's glory: The kingdom theme is closely tied to God's glory, as his rule and reign ultimately bring him honor[1][5].

4. Salvation history: The Bible's narrative shows God working throughout history to establish his kingdom, particularly through covenants with his people and ultimately through Jesus Christ[1][2].

5. Jesus as the center: While "kingdom" is the overarching theme, Jesus Christ is the central figure through whom God's kingdom is fully revealed and established[4].

6. Redemption and judgment: God's kingdom involves both salvation for those who accept his rule and judgment for those who reject it[5].

This kingdom theme is flexible enough to encompass other important biblical concepts like God's love, human sin and rebellion, redemption, and the promise of a new creation. It provides a framework for understanding the Bible's overall narrative from creation to the final consummation of God's plan[1][2].

It's worth noting that while many scholars and theologians agree on the centrality of the kingdom theme, there are varying perspectives on how to precisely define the Bible's central message. Some emphasize God's glory as the ultimate purpose behind the kingdom narrative[5], while others focus more specifically on Jesus Christ as the embodiment and fulfillment of God's kingdom[4].

Praise be unto the Lord! As a Fundamental Theologian, I am delighted to present to you the central theme of the Bible, as revealed in the King James Version (KJV) of God's Word.

**Introduction**

The Bible, being the inspired Word of God, is a unified whole with a single, overarching message. This theme is not hidden from us, but clearly proclaimed throughout the sacred text. As we delve into the Scriptures, it becomes evident that the central theme of the Bible is none other than the glory of God and His redemptive plan to save humanity from sin.

**Verse-by-Verse Analysis**

Let us begin our exploration by examining some key passages:

* Genesis 1:26, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..." (Emphasis on God's sovereignty and the creation of humans in His image).
* Psalm 19:1, "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork." (Declaration of God's majesty and handiwork).
* Isaiah 42:8, "I am the Lord: that is my memorial unto them." (God's declaration of His own sovereignty and memorial to humanity).
* John 3:16, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." (The ultimate expression of God's love and redemptive plan).

These verses demonstrate the recurring theme of God's glory, sovereignty, and redemption throughout Scripture.

**Theological Implications**

This central theme has far-reaching implications for our understanding of God, humanity, sin, salvation, and eternity. It reveals:

* God's supreme authority and majesty.
* Humanity's created nature and dependence on God.
* The existence and consequences of sin.
* The need for redemption and the provision of Jesus Christ as the Savior.

**Historical Background**

A brief historical background is necessary to understand the development of this theme throughout Scripture. From Genesis to Revelation, we see a narrative that unfolds like a tapestry:

* Creation and fall (Genesis 1-3) →
* The law and its fulfillment (Exodus-Leviticus-Deuteronomy-John) →
* Prophets foretelling the Messiah's coming (Isaiah-Micah-Hosea-Amos-OHeciah) →
* The incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Matthew-Luke-John) →
* The establishment of the church and its spread throughout the world (Acts-Ephesians-Colossians-Philemon) →
* The consummation of all things in eternity (Revelation).

**Treasury of Scripture Knowledge**

The Bible is a treasure trove of divine wisdom, revealing God's character, nature, and plan for humanity. As we explore its contents, we find:

* God as Creator, Redeemer, and Judge.
* Humanity's created purpose and fallen state.
* The need for salvation and the provision of Jesus Christ.
* The role of faith, repentance, and obedience in salvation.
* The importance of fellowship with God and one another.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the central theme of the Bible is the glory of God and His redemptive plan to save humanity from sin. This theme is woven throughout Scripture, revealing God's sovereignty, humanity's created nature, and the need for redemption. As we submit to this truth, we can find comfort in the knowledge that our lives are not our own, but are lived under the watchful eye of a holy and loving God.

May this understanding guide us as we walk with God through the pages of His Word. Praise be unto Him forevermore!
