Ephesians 6:10â€“18, is one of the most vital instructions given to the church by the Apostle Paul. It is a divine directive for spiritual warfare, providing the believer with a complete understanding of the nature of our conflict and the heavenly provision for our victory. 
# Introduction To The Spiritual Warfare

The context of this passage is the culmination of Paul's letter to the church at Ephesus. Having laid a foundation of doctrine concerning salvation, the unity of the church, and righteous living, he concludes with this powerful exhortation. He transitions from instruction on earthly relationships to the reality of the unseen spiritual battle that every believer faces. This is not mere allegory but a literal description of a conflict against a formidable, intelligent, and malevolent foe.

# Commentary

## **Ephesians 6:10** : "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."

Paul begins with a charge to be "strong," yet he immediately clarifies the source of this strength. It is not our own resolve or natural ability, but it is to be found "in the Lord." The strength required for this warfare is a derived strength, drawn from our union with Christ. The phrase "the power of his might" emphasizes the limitless, omnipotent force of God that is available to the believer. As the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge cross-references, this echoes the strength given to Joshua in Joshua 1:6-7 and the promise found in Isaiah 40:29-31, "But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength."

## **Ephesians 6:11** : "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."

Here, the central command is given: "Put on the whole armour of God." This is an active, decisive step the believer must take. The armor is not automatically applied but must be consciously appropriated. The purpose is specific: to "stand against the wiles of the devil." The Greek word for "wiles" (_methodeia_) speaks of cunning devices, stratagems, and deceitful arts. Satan's primary mode of attack is through deception and schemes. The armor of God is our defense against his craftiness.

## **Ephesians 6:12** : "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."

This verse reveals the true identity of our enemy. Our struggle is not with human beings ("flesh and blood") but with a hierarchy of demonic spirits. Paul lists them in descending order of rank and authority:

- **Principalities:** Ruling demonic princes set over nations and regions.

- **Powers:** The authorities and potentates of the demonic realm who execute the will of the principalities.

- **Rulers of the darkness of this world:** The demonic entities that control the world's sinful systems, philosophies, and ideologies.

- **Spiritual wickedness in high places:** The vast hosts of evil spirits operating in the heavenly or spiritual realm, influencing humanity toward evil.

This verse confirms that our daily struggles with sin, temptation, and opposition often have a spiritual source that must be combated with spiritual weapons.

## **Ephesians 6:13** : "Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."

Because the enemy is so formidable, Paul repeats the command to "take unto you the whole armour." The objective is to "withstand in the evil day" which is a time of intense trial, temptation, or direct spiritual assault. After employing every piece of God's provision and fighting the battle ("having done all"), the goal is simply "to stand." This signifies holding our ground, maintaining our position in Christ, and not being moved or defeated.

## **Ephesians 6:14** : "Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"

Now Paul details the specific pieces of the armor, which are modeled on the equipment of a Roman soldier.

- **The Belt of Truth:** A soldier's belt, or girdle, held his tunic in place and secured his sword. Spiritually, this is **truth**. It encompasses both the objective truth of God's Word in John 17:17 and a personal life of integrity, sincerity, and honesty. Truth holds the believer's life together and prepares him for action.

- **The Breastplate of Righteousness:** The breastplate protected the soldier's vital organs, primarily the heart. Spiritually, this is the righteousness of Christ imputed to us at salvation in 2 Corinthians 5:21, which protects our heart from condemnation and accusation. It also refers to the practical righteousness of a holy life, which guards our affections and conscience from the attacks of sin. Isaiah 59:17 speaks of God Himself putting on righteousness as a breastplate.

## **Ephesians 6:15** : "And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"

A soldier needed sturdy, reliable footwear for stability in combat and swiftness in movement. Our spiritual footwear is the "preparation of the gospel of peace." This provides the believer with a firm footing and readiness. It speaks of the peace we have with God through the gospel in Romans 5:1, which gives us stability in trial, and a readiness to carry that same gospel message to others, as noted in Isaiah 52:7, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace."

## **Ephesians 6:16** : "Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."

The phrase "above all" signifies that this piece covers and protects all the others. The Roman shield was large, often covered in leather that could be soaked in water to extinguish flaming arrows. Our **shield of faith** is our active trust and reliance upon God and His promises. It extinguishes the "fiery darts" of the wicked one which are temptations, blasphemous thoughts, doubts, despair, and accusations that Satan hurls at the mind and heart of the believer.

## **Ephesians 6:17** : "And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"

- **The Helmet of Salvation:** The helmet protected the soldier's head. Spiritually, the "helmet of salvation" guards the mind. It is the assurance and confidence of our deliverance from sin's penalty, power, and, one day, its very presence. Knowing we are eternally secure in Christ according to 1 Thessalonians 5:8 protects our minds from doubt, fear, and hopelessness.

- **The Sword of the Spirit:** This is the only offensive weapon listed. The Roman soldier carried a short sword (_gladius_) for close-quarters combat. Our sword is "the word of God." It is the _rhema_, the spoken word of God.
