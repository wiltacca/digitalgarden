# The Manifesto of The King

![Pasted image 20250725163402.png|500](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250725163402.png)

# **Introduction**

We turn our hearts and minds to the Gospel According to Matthew chapters five through seven, a portion of Holy Scripture so profound, so rich with divine wisdom, that it has been rightly called the Magna Carta of the Kingdom of Heaven. Here, upon a mountain in Galilee, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, seeing the multitudes, and with His disciples gathered near, opened His mouth and taught them the foundational principles of His kingdom. This was no ordinary discourse; it was the very manifesto of the King, a declaration of the righteousness that exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees.

The setting itself is of great significance. As Moses ascended Mount Sinai to receive the Law amidst thunder and lightning, so Christ, the new and greater Moses, ascends a mount to deliver the law of the new covenant, not with the terror of the old, but with grace and truth. He is not merely a prophet, but the very Son of God, speaking with an authority that astonished all who heard Him.

In this sermon, we find the perfect standard for the Christian life, a portrait of the character and conduct of those who would be citizens of the kingdom of heaven. It is a call to a righteousness that is not merely external, but internal, a righteousness of the heart, wrought by the Spirit of God. We shall, with God's help, undertake a careful examination of these sacred words, seeking to understand their deep and abiding truth.

# **The Beatitudes: The Character of The Blessed Matthew 5:3-12**

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 5:3-12 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:3-12&version=kjv)
> 3. Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
> 4. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
> 5. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
> 6. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
> 7. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
> 8. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
> 9. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
> 10. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
> 11. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
> 12. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

The sermon commences with a series of eight blessings, known as the Beatitudes. These are not eight different types of disciples, but eight characteristics of every true believer.

- **"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 5:3** This is not a commendation of poverty in worldly goods, but of a humble and contrite spirit, a recognition of our spiritual bankruptcy before a holy God. The Scripture directs us to Isaiah 57:15, "For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones."

- **"Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted." Matthew 5:4** This is not the mourning of worldly sorrow, but a godly sorrow for sin, both our own and that of the world. It is the mourning of those who long for righteousness and groan under the burden of this present evil age. As we see in 2 Corinthians 7:10, "For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death."

- **"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth." Matthew 5:5** The meek are not the weak, but those who have their strength under control, who are gentle and patient, and who do not insist on their own rights. They are those who, like their Master, are "meek and lowly in heart" Matthew 11:29. They shall inherit the earth, not by conquest, but by the gift of God.

- **"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled." Matthew 5:6** This is an intense, consuming desire for personal holiness and for the advancement of God's righteous kingdom. It is a hunger that only God can satisfy, and He promises that those who have it shall be filled.

- **"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy." Matthew 5:7** The merciful are those who show compassion and forgiveness to others, because they have received mercy from God. This is a practical outworking of our own experience of God's grace. As our Lord teaches in the parable of the unmerciful servant, we are to forgive as we have been forgiven Matthew 18:21-35.

- **"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." Matthew 5:8** This speaks of an inner purity, a heart that is free from defilement and devoted to God. It is a heart that has been cleansed by the blood of Christ and is set on things above. Only the pure in heart can truly perceive and enjoy the presence of God.

- **"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God." Matthew 5:9** Peacemakers are not merely those who love peace, but those who actively work to reconcile men to God and to one another. They reflect the character of their Heavenly Father, the "God of peace" Romans 15:33.

- **"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 5:10-12** The world will often hate and persecute those who live according to these principles, for the light exposes the darkness. But our Lord pronounces a blessing upon such, for their reward is great in heaven.

# **The Higher Righteousness Matthew 5:17-48**

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 5:17-48 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:17-48&version=kjv)
> 17. Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
> 18. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
> 19. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
> 20. For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
> 21. Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
> 22. But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
> 23. Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
> 24. Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
> 25. Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
> 26. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
> 27. Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
> 28. But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
> 29. And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
> 30. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
> 31. It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
> 32. But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.
> 33. Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
> 34. But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:
> 35. Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
> 36. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
> 37. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
> 38. Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
> 39. But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
> 40. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.
> 41. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
> 42. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
> 43. Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
> 44. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
> 45. That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
> 46. For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
> 47. And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?
> 48. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

Our Lord then proceeds to declare that He has not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it. He reveals the true and deeper meaning of the commandments, showing that they extend not only to outward actions, but to the thoughts and intents of the heart.

- **On Murder and Anger Matthew 5:21-26** The law says, "Thou shalt not kill," but Jesus declares that causeless anger and contemptuous words are tantamount to murder in the heart and make one liable to judgment.

- **On Adultery and Lust Matthew 5:27-30** The law forbids the act of adultery, but Jesus teaches that a lustful look is adultery in the heart. He uses strong, hyperbolic language about plucking out an eye or cutting off a hand to emphasize the radical measures we must take to deal with sin.

- **On Divorce Matthew 5:31-32** He corrects the loose interpretation of the law concerning divorce, permitting it only on the grounds of fornication.

- **On Oaths Matthew 5:33-37** He commands that our speech be plain and truthful, "Yea, yea; Nay, nay," without the need for elaborate oaths, which were often used to deceive.

- **On Retaliation Matthew 5:38-42** The principle of "an eye for an eye" was a law of public justice, not personal revenge. Jesus calls His disciples to a higher standard of non-retaliation and generous love.

- **On Loving Enemies Matthew 5:43-48** The ultimate expression of this higher righteousness is to love our enemies, to bless them that curse us, and to pray for them which despitefully use us. In so doing, we demonstrate that we are the children of our Father in heaven, who sends His rain on the just and on the unjust.

# **True Piety Matthew 6:1-18**

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 6:1-18 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6:1-18&version=kjv)
> 1. Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
> 2. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
> 3. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
> 4. That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
> 5. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
> 6. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
> 7. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
> 8. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
> 9. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
> 10. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is  in heaven.
> 11. Give us this day our daily bread.
> 12. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
> 13. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
> 14. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
> 15. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
> 16. Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
> 17. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
> 18. That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

In this chapter, our Lord instructs us on the practice of our religious duties, warning against the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, who performed their righteous acts to be seen of men.

- **Giving to the Needy Matthew 6:1-4** Our alms are to be given in secret, not with the sounding of a trumpet, that our reward may be from our Father who sees in secret.

- **Prayer Matthew 6:5-15** We are to pray in private, not with vain repetitions, but with sincere hearts. Our Lord then gives us a model prayer, the "Our Father," which teaches us the proper objects and attitudes of prayer.

- **Fasting Matthew 6:16-18** Our fasting is to be unto God, not to gain the praise of men.

# **Trust In God & The Rejection of Materialism Matthew 6:19-34**

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 6:19-34 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6:19-34&version=kjv)
> 19. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
> 20. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
> 21. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
> 22. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
> 23. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is  that darkness!
> 24. No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
> 25. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
> 26. Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
> 27. Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
> 28. And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
> 29. And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
> 30. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
> 31. Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
> 32. (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
> 33. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
> 34. Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

Our Lord warns against laying up treasures on earth, where they are perishable, but to lay up treasures in heaven. We cannot serve both God and mammon (money). He then gives a beautiful discourse on the providence of God, encouraging us not to be anxious about our material needs, but to "seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."

# **Judgment, Discernment, & The Way of Life Matthew 7:1-29**

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 7:1-29 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7:1-29&version=kjv)
> 1. Judge not, that ye be not judged.
> 2. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
> 3. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
> 4. Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
> 5. Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
> 6. Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
> 7. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
> 8. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
> 9. Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
> 10. Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
> 11. If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
> 12. Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
> 13. Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
> 14. Because strait is the gate, and narrow is  the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
> 15. Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
> 16. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
> 17. Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
> 18. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
> 19. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
> 20. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
> 21. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
> 22. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
> 23. And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
> 24. Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
> 25. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
> 26. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
> 27. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
> 28. And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:
> 29. For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

The final chapter of the sermon provides practical guidance for our relationships with others and our walk with God.

- **On Judging Others Matthew 7:1-6** We are warned against a censorious, hypocritical spirit of judgment, yet we are also called to exercise discernment, not to cast that which is holy to the dogs.

- **The Golden Rule Matthew 7:12** "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." This is the sum of our duty to our neighbor.

- **The Two Ways Matthew 7:13-14** There is a broad way that leads to destruction and a narrow way that leads to life, and we are exhorted to enter in at the strait gate.

- **False Prophets Matthew 7:15-20** We are to be wary of false prophets, who come in sheep's clothing but are inwardly ravening wolves. We shall know them by their fruits.

- **The True Foundation Matthew 7:21-29** The sermon concludes with a solemn warning that not everyone who says, "Lord, Lord," shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of the Father. Our profession must be matched by our practice. The wise man is he who hears these sayings of Christ and does them, building his house upon a rock, which will stand firm in the day of judgment.

# **Conclusion**

The Sermon on the Mount is a call to a radical discipleship, a life lived in submission to the King and His righteous reign. It is a standard that we cannot attain in our own strength, but which, by the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit, we are called to pursue. May we, like the multitudes, be astonished at His doctrine, for He taught as one having authority, and not as the scribes. And may we, by His grace, be not only hearers of the word, but doers also, that we may be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
