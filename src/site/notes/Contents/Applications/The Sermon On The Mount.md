# **Introduction**

We turn our hearts and minds to the Gospel According to Matthew chapters five through seven, a portion of Holy Scripture so profound, so rich with divine wisdom, that it has been rightly called the Magna Carta of the Kingdom of Heaven. Here, upon a mountain in Galilee, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, seeing the multitudes, and with His disciples gathered near, opened His mouth and taught them the foundational principles of His kingdom. This was no ordinary discourse; it was the very manifesto of the King, a declaration of the righteousness that exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees.

The setting itself is of great significance. As Moses ascended Mount Sinai to receive the Law amidst thunder and lightning, so Christ, the new and greater Moses, ascends a mount to deliver the law of the new covenant, not with the terror of the old, but with grace and truth. He is not merely a prophet, but the very Son of God, speaking with an authority that astonished all who heard Him.

In this sermon, we find the perfect standard for the Christian life, a portrait of the character and conduct of those who would be citizens of the kingdom of heaven. It is a call to a righteousness that is not merely external, but internal, a righteousness of the heart, wrought by the Spirit of God. We shall, with God's help, undertake a careful examination of these sacred words, seeking to understand their deep and abiding truth.

# **The Beatitudes: The Character of The Blessed Matthew 5:3-12**

The sermon commences with a series of eight blessings, known as the Beatitudes. These are not eight different types of disciples, but eight characteristics of every true believer.

- **"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 5:3** This is not a commendation of poverty in worldly goods, but of a humble and contrite spirit, a recognition of our spiritual bankruptcy before a holy God. The Scripture directs us to Isaiah 57:15, "For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones."

- **"Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted." Matthew 5:4** This is not the mourning of worldly sorrow, but a godly sorrow for sin, both our own and that of the world. It is the mourning of those who long for righteousness and groan under the burden of this present evil age. As we see in 2 Corinthians 7:10, "For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death."

- **"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth." Matthew 5:5** The meek are not the weak, but those who have their strength under control, who are gentle and patient, and who do not insist on their own rights. They are those who, like their Master, are "meek and lowly in heart" Matthew 11:29. They shall inherit the earth, not by conquest, but by the gift of God.

- **"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled." Matthew 5:6** This is an intense, consuming desire for personal holiness and for the advancement of God's righteous kingdom. It is a hunger that only God can satisfy, and He promises that those who have it shall be filled.

- **"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy." Matthew 5:7** The merciful are those who show compassion and forgiveness to others, because they have received mercy from God. This is a practical outworking of our own experience of God's grace. As our Lord teaches in the parable of the unmerciful servant, we are to forgive as we have been forgiven Matthew 18:21-35.

- **"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." Matthew 5:8** This speaks of an inner purity, a heart that is free from defilement and devoted to God. It is a heart that has been cleansed by the blood of Christ and is set on things above. Only the pure in heart can truly perceive and enjoy the presence of God.

- **"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God." Matthew 5:9** Peacemakers are not merely those who love peace, but those who actively work to reconcile men to God and to one another. They reflect the character of their Heavenly Father, the "God of peace" Romans 15:33.

- **"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 5:10-12** The world will often hate and persecute those who live according to these principles, for the light exposes the darkness. But our Lord pronounces a blessing upon such, for their reward is great in heaven.

# **The Higher Righteousness Matthew 5:17-48**

Our Lord then proceeds to declare that He has not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it. He reveals the true and deeper meaning of the commandments, showing that they extend not only to outward actions, but to the thoughts and intents of the heart.

- **On Murder and Anger Matthew 5:21-26** The law says, "Thou shalt not kill," but Jesus declares that causeless anger and contemptuous words are tantamount to murder in the heart and make one liable to judgment.

- **On Adultery and Lust Matthew 5:27-30** The law forbids the act of adultery, but Jesus teaches that a lustful look is adultery in the heart. He uses strong, hyperbolic language about plucking out an eye or cutting off a hand to emphasize the radical measures we must take to deal with sin.

- **On Divorce Matthew 5:31-32** He corrects the loose interpretation of the law concerning divorce, permitting it only on the grounds of fornication.

- **On Oaths Matthew 5:33-37** He commands that our speech be plain and truthful, "Yea, yea; Nay, nay," without the need for elaborate oaths, which were often used to deceive.

- **On Retaliation Matthew 5:38-42** The principle of "an eye for an eye" was a law of public justice, not personal revenge. Jesus calls His disciples to a higher standard of non-retaliation and generous love.

- **On Loving Enemies Matthew 5:43-48** The ultimate expression of this higher righteousness is to love our enemies, to bless them that curse us, and to pray for them which despitefully use us. In so doing, we demonstrate that we are the children of our Father in heaven, who sends His rain on the just and on the unjust.

# **True Piety Matthew 6**

In this chapter, our Lord instructs us on the practice of our religious duties, warning against the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, who performed their righteous acts to be seen of men.

- **Giving to the Needy Matthew 6:1-4** Our alms are to be given in secret, not with the sounding of a trumpet, that our reward may be from our Father who sees in secret.

- **Prayer Matthew 6:5-15** We are to pray in private, not with vain repetitions, but with sincere hearts. Our Lord then gives us a model prayer, the "Our Father," which teaches us the proper objects and attitudes of prayer.

- **Fasting Matthew 6:16-18** Our fasting is to be unto God, not to gain the praise of men.

# **Trust In God & The Rejection of Materialism Matthew 6:19-34**

Our Lord warns against laying up treasures on earth, where they are perishable, but to lay up treasures in heaven. We cannot serve both God and mammon (money). He then gives a beautiful discourse on the providence of God, encouraging us not to be anxious about our material needs, but to "seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."

# **Judgment, Discernment, & The Way of Life Matthew 7**

The final chapter of the sermon provides practical guidance for our relationships with others and our walk with God.

- **On Judging Others Matthew 7:1-6** We are warned against a censorious, hypocritical spirit of judgment, yet we are also called to exercise discernment, not to cast that which is holy to the dogs.

- **The Golden Rule Matthew 7:12** "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." This is the sum of our duty to our neighbor.

- **The Two Ways Matthew 7:13-14** There is a broad way that leads to destruction and a narrow way that leads to life, and we are exhorted to enter in at the strait gate.

- **False Prophets Matthew 7:15-20** We are to be wary of false prophets, who come in sheep's clothing but are inwardly ravening wolves. We shall know them by their fruits.

- **The True Foundation Matthew 7:21-29** The sermon concludes with a solemn warning that not everyone who says, "Lord, Lord," shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of the Father. Our profession must be matched by our practice. The wise man is he who hears these sayings of Christ and does them, building his house upon a rock, which will stand firm in the day of judgment.

# **Conclusion**

The Sermon on the Mount is a call to a radical discipleship, a life lived in submission to the King and His righteous reign. It is a standard that we cannot attain in our own strength, but which, by the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit, we are called to pursue. May we, like the multitudes, be astonished at His doctrine, for He taught as one having authority, and not as the scribes. And may we, by His grace, be not only hearers of the word, but doers also, that we may be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
