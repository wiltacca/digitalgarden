# Christianity Versus Buddhism In Salvation

# 基督教与佛教在救赎论上的对决

# The Fundamental Distinction: Divine Grace Versus Self-Effort

# 根本区别：神的恩典与自我努力

Christianity and Buddhism present two fundamentally divergent approaches to salvation and liberation from suffering. The Christian doctrine of salvation, as established in the KJV Bible, declares that "by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast" Ephesians 2:8-9. This stands in stark contrast to Buddhism's emphasis on personal effort and self-liberation through the cessation of suffering via the Eightfold Path and meditation practices.

基督教和佛教对救赎和解脱苦难提出了两种截然不同的方法。正如圣经所确立的，基督教的救赎教义宣称：“你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。”（以弗所书 2:8-9）。这与佛教强调通过八正道和禅修实践来止息痛苦，从而达至个人努力和自我解脱的观点形成鲜明对比。

# The Nature of The Human Condition

# 人性的本质

## The Christian View: Original Sin and Separation from God

## 基督教观点：原罪与和神隔绝

According to the sacred Scriptures, the human condition is rooted in the doctrine of original sin. Romans 5:12 declares, "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned". This passage reveals that through Adam's transgression, all humanity has inherited a sinful nature that separates them from the holy God.

根据圣经，人性的光景根植于原罪的教义。罗马书 5:12 宣告：“这就如罪是从一人入了世界，死又是从罪来的；于是死就临到众人，因为众人都犯了罪。” 这段经文揭示了，因亚当的过犯，全人类都继承了罪性，这罪性使他们与圣洁的神隔绝。

The Bible emphatically states that "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" Romans 3:23. This universal condemnation places every human being under the wrath of God and in need of divine intervention for salvation. The Scripture confirms this truth through numerous cross-references that demonstrate the consistency of this doctrine throughout Scripture.

圣经明确指出：“因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀”（罗马书 3:23）。这普世性的定罪将每个人都置于神的忿怒之下，并需要神的干预才能得救。圣经通过大量的相互参照证实了这一真理，显示了此教义在整本圣经中的一致性。
## The Buddhist View: Suffering and the Cycle of Rebirth

## 佛教观点：苦与轮回

Buddhism, conversely, views the human condition through the lens of the Four Noble Truths. The first truth acknowledges the reality of suffering (dukkha), which encompasses not merely physical pain but the fundamental unsatisfactoriness of existence. The second truth identifies the cause of suffering as craving (tanha) and attachment, which perpetuates the cycle of rebirth (samsara).

相反，佛教则通过四圣谛的视角来看待人性的光景。第一圣谛承认苦（dukkha）的实相，它不仅包括身体的痛苦，也涵盖了生存中根本的不圆满性。第二圣谛指明苦的起因是渴爱（tanha）和执着，这使得轮回（samsara）永无止境。

Buddhist teachings assert that individuals are trapped in an endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth across six realms of existence, driven by karma - the law of cause and effect based on one's actions. Liberation comes through the cessation of craving and the realization of the impermanent, suffering-filled, and selfless nature of existence.

佛教教义主张，个体因其行为所产生的因果法则——业力（karma）的驱动，被困于六道轮回之中，经历着无尽的生死循环。解脱来自于止息渴爱，并了悟存在的无常、充满痛苦和无我的本性。

# The Means of Salvation

# 得救之法

## Christianity: Salvation by Grace Through Faith

## 基督教：因信靠恩典得救

The Christian doctrine of salvation is exclusively centered upon the atoning work of Jesus Christ. The Bible declares that "the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" Romans 6:23. This salvation is accomplished through Christ's substitutionary atonement on the cross, where He bore the penalty for humanity's sin.

基督教的救赎教义完全以耶稣基督的赎罪工作为中心。圣经宣告：“因为罪的工价乃是死；惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。”（罗马书 6:23）。这份救恩是通过基督在十字架上的替代性赎罪完成的，祂在那里承担了人类罪恶的刑罚。

The Scriptures reveal that salvation is entirely a work of God's grace. "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast" Ephesians 2:8-9. This grace is received through faith in Jesus Christ, as Romans 10:9 declares: "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved".

圣经启示，救恩完全是神恩典的工作。“你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。”（以弗所书 2:8-9）。这恩典是借着信耶稣基督而领受的，正如罗马书 10:9 所宣告的：“你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。”

The cross of Calvary stands as the focal point of Christian salvation. "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" Romans 5:8. This substitutionary sacrifice satisfied God's justice while demonstrating His love, providing redemption for all whobelieve.

加略山的十字架是基督教救恩的焦点。“惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。”（罗马书 5:8）。这替代性的牺牲满足了神的公义，同时彰显了祂的爱，为所有相信的人提供了救赎。
## Buddhism: Self-Liberation Through The Eightfold Path

## 佛教：通过八正道自我解脱

Buddhism teaches that liberation (nirvana) must be achieved through personal effort and understanding. The Buddha prescribed the Noble Eightfold Path as the means to end suffering: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.

佛教教导解脱（涅槃，nirvana）必须通过个人的努力和智慧来达成。佛陀教导以八正道作为止息痛苦的方法：正见、正思惟、正语、正业、正命、正精进、正念和正定。

This path emphasizes the cultivation of wisdom through meditation and mindfulness practices, ethical conduct, and the development of mental discipline. The goal is the cessation of craving and the realization of the three marks of existence: impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatta).

这条道路强调通过禅修和正念练习来培养智慧、持守道德行为，以及发展心智的纪律。其目标是止息渴爱，并了悟三法印：无常（anicca）、苦（dukkha）和无我（anatta）。

Buddhist liberation is fundamentally self-directed, requiring practitioners to extinguish their own desires and attachments through sustained effort over multiple lifetimes. The concept of non-self (anatta) teaches that there is no permanent, unchanging soul or self to be saved, only the cessation of the processes that cause suffering.

佛教的解脱基本上是自我导向的，要求修行者在多生多世中通过持续的努力来熄灭自身的欲望和执着。无我（anatta）的概念教导，没有一个永恒不变的灵魂或自我需要被拯救，只有导致痛苦的过程的止息。

# The Role of Divine Intervention

# 神的介入之角色

## Christianity: God's Sovereign Grace

## 基督教：神的主权恩典

The Christian doctrine emphasizes that salvation is entirely dependent upon God's sovereign grace and not upon human merit or effort. "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost" Titus 3:5.

基督教教义强调，救恩完全取决于神的主权恩典，而非人的功德或努力。“他便救了我们，并不是因我们自己所行的义，乃是照他的怜悯，藉着重生的洗和圣灵的更新。”（提多书 3:5）。

The Bible teaches that God is the active agent in salvation, providing redemption through Christ's sacrifice while man remains passive in receiving this gift through faith. The Scripture provides extensive cross-references demonstrating that this doctrine permeates the entire biblical narrative.

圣经教导，神是救恩中的主动者，通过基督的牺牲提供救赎，而人则通过信心被动地接受这份礼物。圣经提供了广泛的相互参照，表明这一教义贯穿了整个圣经的叙事。

## Buddhism: No Divine Savior

## 佛教：没有神圣的救主

Buddhism presents a path of liberation that requires no divine intervention or external savior. The Buddha is viewed as a teacher who discovered the path to enlightenment, but individuals must walk this path themselves. There is no concept of divine grace or intervention to assist in achieving liberation.

佛教提供了一条无需神圣干预或外在救主的解脱之道。佛陀被视为一位发现了觉悟之道的导师，但每个人都必须自己走上这条路。佛教中没有神圣恩典或干预来帮助达成解脱的概念。

The Buddhist emphasis on self-reliance is evident in the teaching that each person must work out their own salvation through diligent practice and the accumulation of good karma over multiple lifetimes. This stands in direct opposition to the Christian doctrine of salvation by grace alone.

佛教对自力更生的强调体现在其教义中，即每个人都必须通过勤奋修行和多生多世积累善业来成就自己的解脱。这与基督教唯独靠恩典得救的教义截然相反。

# The Nature of Salvation

# 救赎的本质

## Christianity: Eternal Life with God

## 基督教：与神同在的永生

Christian salvation offers eternal life in fellowship with God through Jesus Christ. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" John 3:16. This salvation includes justification (being declared righteous), sanctification (being made holy), and glorification (eternal perfection).

基督教的救恩提供了通过耶稣基督与神相交的永生。“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。”（约翰福音 3:16）。这份救恩包括称义（被宣告为义）、成圣（被分别为圣）和得荣（永恒的完美）。

The Christian believer is reconciled to God, adopted as His child, and granted the assurance of eternal life in heaven. This salvation is both a present reality and a future hope, secured by the finished work of Christ.

基督徒与神和好，被收纳为祂的儿女，并被赐予在天国永生的确据。这份救恩既是当下的现实，也是未来的盼望，由基督已完成的工作所保障。
## Buddhism: Extinction of Suffering

## 佛教：苦的寂灭

Buddhist liberation (nirvana) is described as the extinction of suffering through the cessation of craving and the cycle of rebirth. It is not a place or state of being but rather the absence of the conditions that cause suffering. This liberation represents the complete annihilation of the individual consciousness, as there is no permanent self to continue.

佛教的解脱（涅槃，nirvana）被描述为通过止息渴爱和轮回而达至的苦的寂灭。它不是一个地方或一种存在状态，而是导致痛苦的条件的消失。这种解脱代表了个体意识的彻底寂灭，因为没有永恒的自我可以延续下去。

Nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice, achieved when one has eliminated all desires, attachments, and the illusion of self. This state marks the end of the cycle of rebirth and the complete cessation of suffering.

涅槃是佛教修行的最终目标，当一个人消除了所有欲望、执着和自我的幻觉时即可达成。这种状态标志着轮回的终结和痛苦的完全止息。

# Historical Context & Theological Implications

# 历史背景与神学意涵

The fundamental difference between Christianity and Buddhism lies in their theological foundations. Christianity is rooted in the revelation of God's character as holy, just, and loving, requiring atonement for sin while providing salvation through divine grace. Buddhism, emerging from Hindu philosophical traditions, focuses on the individual's ability to achieve liberation through understanding and personal effort.

基督教和佛教的根本区别在于它们的神学基础。基督教根植于对神圣洁、公义和慈爱属性的启示，要求为罪付上赎价，同时通过神的恩典提供救恩。佛教源于印度教的哲学传统，专注于个体通过智慧和个人努力来达成解脱的能力。

The Scripture demonstrates the consistency of Christian salvation doctrine throughout both the Old and New Testaments, showing how the sacrificial system of the Old Testament prefigured the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. This continuity of divine revelation stands in contrast to Buddhism's philosophical approach to understanding existence and suffering.

圣经展示了基督教救赎教义在旧约和新约中的一致性，表明旧约的献祭制度如何预表了基督最终的献祭。这种神圣启示的连续性与佛教理解存在与苦难的哲学方法形成对比。

# Practical Implications For Adherents

# 对信徒的实际影响

## Christian Assurance and Security

## 基督徒的确据与保障

The Christian doctrine of salvation by grace provides believers with assurance of their eternal security. "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life" 1 John 5:13. This assurance rests not on human performance but on the finished work of Christ and God's unchanging promises.

基督教因恩典得救的教义为信徒提供了永恒保障的确据。“我将这些话写给你们信奉神儿子之名的人，要叫你们知道自己有永生。”（约翰一书 5:13）。这份确据不依赖于人的表现，而是建立在基督已完成的工作和神永不改变的应许之上。
## Buddhist Uncertainty and Self-Reliance

## 佛教的不确定性与自力更生

Buddhism offers no such assurance, as liberation depends entirely on one's own efforts and understanding. The practitioner must continuously strive to eliminate desire and attachment, with no guarantee of success even across multiple lifetimes. This uncertainty is inherent in a system that relies on human effort rather than divine grace.

佛教不提供这样的确据，因为解脱完全取决于自身的努力和智慧。修行者必须不断努力消除欲望和执着，即使历经多生多世也无法保证成功。这种不确定性是依赖于人的努力而非神恩典的体系所固有的。

# Conclusion: The Irreconcilable Difference

# 结论：不可调和的差异

The comparison between Christianity and Buddhism in matters of salvation reveals two fundamentally irreconcilable worldviews. Christianity proclaims salvation as a gift of God's grace received through faith in Jesus Christ, while Buddhism teaches self-liberation through personal effort and understanding. The Christian believer rests in the finished work of Christ on the cross, while the Buddhist practitioner must continuously strive for liberation through their own efforts.

在救赎问题上，基督教与佛教的比较揭示了两种根本上不可调和的世界观。基督教宣称救恩是神恩典的礼物，通过信靠耶稣基督而领受；而佛教则教导通过个人努力和智慧来达至自我解脱。基督徒安息在基督在十字架上已完成的工作中，而佛教修行者则必须通过自己的努力不断追求解脱。

The Bible's testimony is clear: "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved" Acts4:12. This exclusive claim of Christianity stands in direct opposition to Buddhism's humanistic approach to salvation, making any synthesis of these two systems impossible while maintaining the integrity of biblical truth.

圣经的见证是明确的：“除他以外，别无拯救；因为在天下人间，没有赐下别的名，我们可以靠着得救。”（使徒行传 4:12）。基督教的这种排他性主张与佛教的人本主义救赎观截然相反，这使得在维护圣经真理完整性的前提下，任何试图融合这两种体系的做法都成为不可能。

The KJV Bible affirm that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone - a doctrine that cannot be reconciled with Buddhism's emphasis on self-effort and human achievement. Therefore, the Christian must reject the Buddhist path as fundamentally opposed to the biblical doctrine of salvation and continue to proclaim the exclusive gospel of Jesus Christ as the only way to eternal life.

圣经确认，救恩是唯独靠恩典、唯独藉信心、唯独在基督里——这一教义无法与佛教强调自我努力和人的成就相调和。因此，基督徒必须拒绝佛教的道路，因为它从根本上与圣经的救赎教义相悖，并应继续宣扬唯独耶稣基督的福音，将其作为通往永生的唯一道路。
