# Part I: The Christian Paradigm of Salvation: Redemption By Grace

# 第一部分：基督教的救贖範式：藉恩典得救贖

The Christian soteriological framework presents a coherent and internally consistent narrative that moves from a diagnosis of the universal human condition to a specific divine intervention, a prescribed human response, and a final, eternal telos. The entire structure is predicated on the existence of a personal, holy, and loving Creator God, against whom humanity is in a state of rebellion. Salvation, therefore, is not merely an escape from suffering but a profound act of redemption and reconciliation, initiated and accomplished by God Himself. It is the story of being rescued from a state of spiritual death and restored to a relationship of eternal life.

基督教的救贖論框架提出了一個連貫且內部一致的敘述，從對普世人類狀況的診斷，到特定的神聖干預，再到指定的人類回應，以及最終永恆的終極目標（telos）。這整個結構都基於一位有位格、聖潔且慈愛的造物主上帝的存在，而人類正處於悖逆祂的狀態。因此，救贖不僅僅是逃避苦難，更是一個由上帝親自發起並完成的深刻的救贖與和解行動。這是一個從靈性死亡的狀態中被拯救，並恢復到永生關係的故事。

## 1.1 The Diagnosis: Original Sin and the Estrangement from God

## 1.1 診斷：原罪與跟上帝的疏離

The Christian understanding of salvation begins with its diagnosis of the fundamental human problem: sin. This is not simply a reference to individual wrongdoings but to a deeper, inherited state of being known as Original Sin. This doctrine posits that all human beings are born into a condition of sinfulness, a state of moral corruption and imputed guilt inherited from the first humans, Adam and Eve.

基督教對救贖的理解始於其對人類根本問題的診斷：罪。這不僅僅是指個人的過錯，而是指一種更深層次的、與生俱來的存在狀態，即所謂的原罪。此教義主張，所有人都生而處於罪惡的狀態，這是一種道德敗壞和從始祖亞當夏娃繼承而來的歸算之罪。

The biblical foundation for this doctrine is rooted in the narrative of the Fall in the third chapter of the Book of Genesis. Here, Adam and Eve, living in a state of innocence and direct communion with God, disobey a specific divine command by eating from the forbidden tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This act of defiance is presented as a catastrophic historical event with universal consequences. It introduces not only physical mortality and hardship into the world but, more significantly, spiritual death—a profound separation from God, the source of life. Theologians, most notably the Apostle Paul, later systematized this narrative. In his Epistle to the Romans, Paul frames Adam as the "one man" through whom "sin entered the world, and death through sin" Romans 5:12. In this view, Adam acts as a federal head or representative of the entire human race, and his transgression results in a state of condemnation being passed down to all his descendants.

該教義的聖經基礎植根於《創世記》第三章中關於墮落的敘述。在這裡，生活在純真狀態並與神直接相交的亞當和夏娃，因吃了禁樹上分別善惡樹的果子而違背了上帝的明確命令。這一悖逆行為被描述為一個具有普世後果的災難性歷史事件。它不僅給世界帶來了肉體的死亡和苦難，更重要的是，帶來了靈性的死亡——與生命之源上帝的深刻分離。神學家們，尤其是使徒保羅，後來將這一敘述系統化。在他的《羅馬書》中，保羅將亞當視為「一人」，「罪是從一人入了世界，死又是從罪來的」（羅馬書 5:12）。在此觀點中，亞當作為全人類的盟約元首或代表，他的過犯導致定罪的狀態傳給了他所有的後裔。

The theological implications of Original Sin are vast and define the human predicament. The inherited condition is one of total depravity. This does not mean that humans are as evil as they could possibly be, but rather that every aspect of human nature—the intellect, the will, the emotions, the physical body—has been corrupted by sin and is inclined away from God. The human heart is described as "deceitful above all things and beyond cure" Jeremiah 17:9, and individuals are considered "by nature children of wrath" Ephesians 2:3.4 Consequently, humanity in its natural state is spiritually dead, enslaved to sin, and utterly incapable of saving itself, pleasing God, or even choosing to follow God apart from a preemptive act of divine grace. This helplessness is a core premise of Christian soteriology.

原罪的神學意涵是巨大的，它定義了人類的困境。這種繼承而來的狀態是完全的墮落。這並不意味著人類已經壞到無以復加，而是指人性的每個方面——智力、意志、情感、身體——都已被罪所敗壞，並且傾向於遠離上帝。人心被描述為「比萬物都詭詐，壞到極處」（耶利米書 17:9），並且個人被認為是「本為可怒之子」（以弗所書 2:3）。因此，處於自然狀態的人類在靈性上是死的，被罪奴役，完全沒有能力自救、取悅上帝，甚至在沒有神聖恩典的預先行動下，也無法選擇跟隨上帝。這種無助感是基督教救贖論的核心前提。

Different Christian traditions interpret the precise nature of this inherited corruption with some variation. Pelagianism, a view condemned as heretical, argued that Adam's sin merely provided a bad example, with no inherent corruption passed to his descendants. Arminianism holds that humanity inherits a corrupt sin nature from Adam, which makes sinning natural and unavoidable, but posits that God's "prevenient grace" enables individuals to freely choose to accept or reject the offer of salvation. The Calvinistic view, influential in many Protestant denominations, asserts that Adam's sin resulted not only in an inherited corrupt nature but also in the imputation of his guilt, meaning all humans are born legally guilty before God and deserving of punishment.

不同的基督教傳統對這種繼承而來的敗壞的確切性質有不同的解釋。伯拉糾主義，一種被譴責為異端的觀點，認為亞當的罪僅僅提供了一個壞榜樣，並沒有將固有的敗壞傳給他的後裔。阿民念主義認為，人類從亞當那裡繼承了敗壞的罪性，這使得犯罪成為自然且不可避免的，但它主張上帝的「先在恩典」使個人能夠自由選擇接受或拒絕救贖的邀請。在許多新教教派中具有影響力的加爾文主義觀點則斷言，亞當的罪不僅導致了繼承而來的敗壞本性，也導致了他的罪責歸算，意味著所有人生來在上帝面前就有法律上的罪，應受懲罰。

This diagnosis establishes the fundamental nature of the human problem in a way that dictates the necessary form of its solution. The Christian narrative begins with a personal Creator who establishes a covenant—a legal and relational framework—with humanity. Sin is defined as a transgression against God's specific command, a violation of this divine law and a rupture of this personal relationship. The consequence, "eternal death," is therefore a judicial sentence and a state of relational estrangement from a holy God. The problem is not that existence itself is inherently flawed or unsatisfactory; rather, the problem is that humanity is legally guilty before a righteous Judge and relationally alienated from a loving Father. This personal, legal, and relational definition of the problem necessitates a solution that is equally personal, legal, and relational.

這一診斷以一種決定其解決方案必要形式的方式，確立了人類問題的根本性質。基督教的敘事始於一位有位格的造物主，祂與人類建立了一個聖約——一個法律和關係的框架。罪被定義為對上帝特定命令的違背，是對這神聖律法的侵犯，也是對這一個人關係的破裂。因此，其後果「永死」，既是一個司法判決，也是一種與聖潔上帝關係疏離的狀態。問題不在於存在本身有內在缺陷或不令人滿意；相反，問題在於人類在公義的審判官面前有法律上的罪，並且與慈愛的天父在關係上疏遠。這個對問題的個人、法律和關係層面的定義，必然要求一個同樣是個人、法律和關係層面的解決方案。

## 1.2 The Divine Intervention: Atonement and the Christ-Event

## 1.2 神聖的干預：贖罪與基督事件

Given the diagnosis of humanity as spiritually dead and incapable of self-rescue, the Christian framework asserts that the solution to sin must originate entirely from outside the human condition—it must come from God Himself. This divine solution is the "Christ-event": the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is presented not merely as a great moral teacher but as the unique, divine Savior of the world.

鑑於人類在靈性上已死且無法自救的診斷，基督教框架斷言，對罪的解決方案必須完全源於人類狀況之外——它必須來自上帝自己。這個神聖的解決方案就是「基督事件」：耶穌基督的生、死和復活，祂不僅被視為一位偉大的道德導師，更是世界獨一無二的、神聖的救主。

Central to this intervention is the Christian doctrine of Christology. Jesus is understood to be God incarnate, the eternal Son of God, the second Person of the Holy Trinity, who took on human nature without surrendering His divine nature. He is thus "true God and true man". This ontological status is not an incidental detail; it is the very foundation of His saving work. His name, Jesus (derived from the Hebrew Yeshua), literally means "God saves," a name given by heavenly command to signify His mission: "for he will save his people from their sins". Because the offense of sin was against an infinite God, only a being of infinite worth—God Himself—could provide an adequate satisfaction for that offense.

這一干預的核心是基督教的基督論教義。耶穌被理解為道成肉身的上帝，永恆的聖子，三位一體中的第二位格，祂取了人性卻未放棄其神性。因此，祂是「真神真人」。祂的名字，耶穌（源自希伯來語 Yeshua），字面意思是「上帝拯救」，這個名字是奉天命所賜，以表明祂的使命：「因他要將自己的百姓從罪惡裡救出來」。因為罪的冒犯是針對無限的上帝，所以只有一位具有無限價值者——上帝自己——才能為那冒犯提供足夠的補償。

The core of Christ's saving work is the Atonement. The word itself, derived from "at-one-ment," signifies the act of reconciliation between God and humanity. Christian theology understands the death of Jesus on the cross as a vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice. He offered Himself as a "ransom for many" Mark 10:45, taking upon Himself the punishment that humanity deserved for its sin. This act is seen as satisfying the demands of God's perfect justice while simultaneously demonstrating the depths of His love. By His sinless life, Jesus fulfilled the righteous requirements of God's law, and by His sacrificial death, He paid the penalty for humanity's breaking of that law. His resurrection from the dead on the third day serves as the divine vindication of His sacrifice, demonstrating His victory over sin and death and securing the justification of all who believe in Him.

基督救贖工作的核心是贖罪。這個詞本身源於「at-one-ment」（合一），意指上帝與人類之間和解的行為。基督教神學將耶穌在十字架上的死理解為一種替代性的、代贖的獻祭。祂獻上自己作為「多人的贖價」（馬可福音 10:45），承擔了人類因其罪所應得的懲罰。這一行為被視為既滿足了上帝完美公義的要求，同時又彰顯了祂深不可測的愛。藉著祂無罪的一生，耶穌滿足了上帝律法的公義要求；藉著祂的犧牲之死，祂為人類違背律法付上了代價。祂在第三天從死裡復活，作為祂獻祭的神聖明證，彰顯了祂對罪和死亡的勝利，並確保了所有信祂之人的稱義。

Jesus is therefore presented as the exclusive Savior and the sole Mediator between God and humanity. The Apostle Peter proclaims, "There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" Acts 4:12.15 As the perfect God-man, He alone can bridge the chasm of separation caused by sin, uniting humanity with God and bestowing the gifts of salvation and divine life. This mediation is unique and absolute, excluding any other path to reconciliation with the Father.

因此，耶穌被呈現為唯一的救主，以及上帝與人類之間唯一的中保。使徒彼得宣告：「除他以外，別無拯救；因為在天下人間，沒有賜下別的名，我們可以靠着得救。」（使徒行傳 4:12）。作為完美的神人，唯有祂能跨越因罪造成的隔離鴻溝，使人類與上帝聯合，並賜予救恩和神聖生命的恩賜。這種中保身份是獨一無二且絕對的，排除了任何其他與天父和解的途徑。

## 1.3 The Human Response: The Dynamics of Faith, Repentance, and Works

## 1.3 人的回應：信心、悔改與行為的動態關係

While the work of salvation is accomplished entirely by God in Christ, it is not applied to individuals automatically. The Christian framework outlines a specific means by which this divine gift is received: by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone (Sola Gratia, Sola Fide, Solus Christus). This formula, central to Protestant theology in particular, delineates the relationship between divine action and human response.

雖然救贖之工完全由上帝在基督裡完成，但它並非自動應用於個人。基督教框架概述了領受這神聖恩賜的具體方式：唯獨恩典、唯獨信心、唯獨基督（Sola Gratia, Sola Fide, Solus Christus）。這個公式，特別是新教神學的核心，描繪了神聖行動與人類回應之間的關係。

The active principle of salvation is grace (charis), defined as God's unmerited, undeserved, and unearned favor bestowed upon fallen humanity. It is the free gift of God, flowing not from any human worthiness but from His own love and goodness. Critically, the Bible teaches that even the capacity to respond to this offer of salvation is itself a gift of grace. As Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast". God's grace must first act upon the spiritually dead sinner to enable a response.

救贖的主動原則是恩典（charis），定義為上帝賜予墮落人類的不配得、不應得、非賺取的恩惠。這是上帝白白的恩賜，並非源於人的任何價值，而是源於祂自己的愛與良善。至關重要的是，聖經教導說，就連回應這救恩邀請的能力本身也是恩典的禮物。如《以弗所書》2:8-9 所述：「你們得救是本乎恩，也因着信；這並不是出於自己，乃是神所賜的；也不是出於行為，免得有人自誇。」上帝的恩典必須首先作用於靈性上已死的罪人，使其能夠作出回應。

The channel through which this grace is received is faith (pistis). Saving faith is not merely intellectual assent to a set of doctrines, nor is it a blind leap. It is a radical trust in and reliance on the person and finished work of Jesus Christ. It is the "empty hand" that receives the gift of salvation that it could never earn. This faith entails repentance, which is a "change of mind" from an embrace of sin and rejection of Christ to an embrace of Christ and a turning away from sin. This faith is inherently relational. Many Christian traditions emphasize the necessity of a "personal relationship" with Jesus Christ for salvation. This is not a modern innovation but is rooted in biblical language. Jesus states that on the day of judgment, He will say to many who performed religious acts in His name, "I never knew you" Matthew 7:23. The Greek word for "knew" (ginōskō) implies an intimate, experiential knowledge, not a mere factual awareness. Thus, salvation is contingent on being personally known by and knowing Christ, a state of intimate union where the believer is "in Christ" and Christ is "in" the believer.

領受這恩典的管道是信心（pistis）。使人得救的信心不僅僅是對一套教義的理智認同，也不是盲目的跳躍。它是對耶穌基督這個人和祂已完成之工作的徹底信靠與依賴。它是那雙「空空的手」，領受那永遠無法靠自己賺取的救恩禮物。這種信心必然包含悔改，即「心思的轉變」，從擁抱罪、拒絕基督，轉變為擁抱基督、遠離罪。這種信心本質上是關係性的。許多基督教傳統強調，與耶穌基督建立「個人關係」是得救的必要條件。這並非現代的創新，而是植根於聖經的語言。耶穌說，在審判的日子，祂會對許多奉祂名行宗教儀式的人說：「我從來不認識你們」（馬太福音 7:23）。希臘語中「認識」（ginōskō）一詞意味著一種親密的、體驗性的認識，而不僅僅是事實上的知曉。因此，救恩取決於被基督親自認識和認識基督，這是一種親密聯合的狀態，信徒「在基督裡」，基督也「在」信徒裡面。

This leads to the complex question of the role of good works. If salvation is by grace through faith alone, what is the purpose of living a moral life? The consistent teaching across Christian denominations is that good works are not the means or cause of salvation, but the necessary and inevitable evidence or fruit of a genuine, saving faith. A person is not saved by their good works, but a person who is truly saved will produce good works. This resolves the apparent tension between the Apostle Paul's emphasis on salvation by faith apart from works Romans 3:28 and the Apostle James's assertion that "faith without works is dead" James 2:26. James is not arguing for a works-based salvation but is contending that a "faith" that produces no change in life, no obedience, and no good works is not true saving faith at all. It is merely intellectual assent. True salvation, which includes regeneration (being born again) and sanctification (the process of being made more like Christ), will always result in a transformed life. As Ephesians 2:10, which immediately follows the classic "grace through faith" passage, states, "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do".

這就引出了關於好行為作用的複雜問題。如果救恩是唯獨本乎恩、因著信，那麼過合乎道德的生活其目的是什麼？跨基督教各宗派的一致教導是，好行為不是得救的途徑或原因，而是一個真實、使人得救的信心的必要且必然的證據或果子。一個人不是因他的好行為得救，但一個真正得救的人必然會結出好行為的果子。這解決了使徒保羅強調因信得救、不靠行為（羅馬書 3:28）與使徒雅各斷言「信心沒有行為也是死的」（雅各書 2:26）之間的表面張力。雅各並非在主張一種基於行為的救恩，而是在論證，一種不能在生活中產生改變、沒有順服、沒有好行為的「信心」，根本不是真正使人得救的信心。它僅僅是理智上的認同。真正的救恩，包括重生（born again）和成聖（變得更像基督的過程），總會帶來生命的轉變。正如緊隨經典的「本乎恩、因著信」經文之後的《以弗所書》2:10 所說：「我們原是他的工作，在基督耶穌裡造成的，為要叫我們行善，就是神所預備叫我們行的。」

## 1.4 The Ultimate Telos: Eternal Life in Heaven vs. Eternal Damnation

## 1.4 終極目標：天堂裡的永生 vs. 永遠的沉淪

The Christian soteriological narrative culminates in one of two possible, and mutually exclusive, eternal destinies. The final state for those who are saved is not a mystical absorption into a cosmic consciousness or the annihilation of the self, but the perfection and eternal continuation of personal existence in a restored and glorified relationship with God.

基督教的救贖敘事最終導向兩種可能且相互排斥的永恆歸宿之一。對於得救的人來說，最終的狀態不是神秘地融入宇宙意識或自我的消亡，而是在與上帝恢復並得榮耀的關係中，個人存在的完美與永恆延續。

The ultimate goal for the redeemed is Heaven, a state described as Eternal Life. This is defined not merely as an unending quantity of time, but as a new quality of existence characterized by intimate, unending fellowship with the Creator. Jesus defines it in relational terms: "Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent" John 17:3. This state begins at the moment of faith in Christ but finds its ultimate consummation after death and the final judgment. Christian eschatology includes the doctrine of the physical resurrection of the body, where at the end of time, the saved will receive glorified, incorruptible bodies and will inhabit a "new heaven and a new earth". This belief underscores the goodness of God's original physical creation and the redemption of the whole person—body and soul. The ultimate fulfillment of this eternal life is often described as the "Beatific Vision," the direct, unmediated sight of God "face to face," a state of perfect joy and fulfillment where every righteous desire finds its satisfaction in God Himself.

對於被救贖者來說，終極目標是天堂，一種被描述為永生的狀態。這不僅僅被定義為無限長的時間，更是一種新的存在品質，其特點是與造物主親密、無盡的相交。耶穌用關係性的術語來定義它：「認識你－獨一的真神，並且認識你所差來的耶穌基督，這就是永生。」（約翰福音 17:3）。這種狀態始於信靠基督的那一刻，但在死亡和最後的審判之後達到其最終的圓滿。基督教末世論包含身體復活的教義，即在末日之時，得救的人將獲得榮耀、不朽的身體，並居住在「新天新地」。這一信仰強調了上帝最初物質創造的美善，以及全人——身體與靈魂——的救贖。這種永生的最終實現常被描述為「榮福直觀」（Beatific Vision），即直接、無中介地「面對面」看見上帝，這是一種完美的喜樂與滿足的狀態，其中每一個公義的渴望都在上帝自己裡面得到滿足。

The alternative to salvation is Eternal Damnation, a doctrine that, while sobering, is presented as the necessary consequence of rejecting God's offer of grace. Often referred to as hell or the "lake of fire," it is described as a state of conscious, unending punishment and separation from the presence of God. The Bible uses various terms like Sheol, Hades, and Gehenna to describe the abode of the dead and the place of final judgment. The duration of this punishment is presented as permanent. The same Greek adjective, aiōnios (eternal, everlasting), is used in passages like Matthew 25:46 to describe both the "eternal life" of the righteous and the "eternal punishment" of the wicked, indicating their equal permanence. This state is the just outcome for unrepentant sin and the final quarantine of evil from God's renewed creation.

救恩的另一面是永遠的沉淪，這一教義雖然令人警醒，但被呈現為拒絕上帝恩典邀請的必然結果。它通常被稱為地獄或「火湖」，被描述為一種有意識的、無休止的懲罰，以及與上帝同在的分離狀態。聖經使用諸如 Sheol（陰間）、Hades（陰間）和 Gehenna（地獄）等不同術語來描述死者的居所和最終審判之地。這種懲罰的持續時間被描述為永久的。在像《馬太福音》25:46 這樣的經文中，同一個希臘形容詞 aiōnios（永恆的、永遠的）被用來描述義人的「永生」和惡人的「永刑」，表明它們具有同等的永久性。這種狀態是對不悔改之罪的公正結果，也是將邪惡與上帝更新的創造物最終隔離開來。

The Christian understanding of the self and its ultimate destiny is thus one of restoration and glorification, not dissolution. The narrative begins with a God who creates distinct individuals "in His image," giving the self inherent worth and purpose. The problem, sin, is a corruption of this self, not a fundamental flaw in its existence. The process of salvation involves justification (declaring the self righteous before God), sanctification (the lifelong process of transforming the self to be more like Christ), and glorification (the final perfection of the self in the resurrection). The final goal, Heaven, is a state of perfect communion, which logically requires the existence of distinct, perfected individual selves who can relate to God and to one another. The entire soteriological arc of Christianity, from creation to new creation, is focused on redeeming, perfecting, and eternally preserving the individual personhood that was God's original creative intent. This stands in stark contrast to any soteriological system that views the self as an illusion to be extinguished.

因此，基督教對自我及其最終命運的理解是恢復與得榮耀，而非消解。敘事始於一位上帝「按祂的形象」創造了獨特的個體，賦予自我固有的價值和目的。問題，即罪，是這個自我的敗壞，而非其存在的根本缺陷。救贖的過程包括稱義（在上帝面前宣告自我為義）、成聖（一生之久轉化自我以更像基督的過程）和得榮耀（在復活中自我的最終完美）。最終的目標，天堂，是一種完美的相交狀態，這在邏輯上要求存在能夠與上帝及彼此相關的、獨特且完美的個體自我。基督教的整個救贖論弧線，從創造到新創造，都聚焦於救贖、完善並永恆地保存上帝最初創造意圖中的個體人格。這與任何將自我視為應被熄滅的幻象的救贖論體系形成鮮明對比。

# Part II: The Buddhist Paradigm of Liberation: Awakening Through Effort

# 第二部分：佛教的解脫範式：透過努力以達覺醒

The Buddhist paradigm of liberation offers a profoundly different map of the human condition and its resolution. Operating from a non-theistic worldview, it does not diagnose the problem in terms of sin against a deity but as a universal state of existential suffering. Consequently, the solution is not a divine rescue but a methodical path of self-cultivation aimed at awakening to the true nature of reality. Liberation in Buddhism is not about being saved by an external power, but about achieving freedom from the internal mechanisms of suffering through one's own disciplined effort.

佛教的解脫範式為人類的狀況及其解決方案提供了一幅截然不同的地圖。它從一個非有神論的世界觀出發，不把問題診斷為對神祇的罪，而是視為一種普世性的存在之苦。因此，其解決方案不是神聖的拯救，而是一條旨在覺醒於實相本質的系統性自我修行之道。佛教的解脫並非關乎被外在力量拯救，而是關乎通過自身有紀律的努力，從內在的痛苦機制中獲得自由。
## 2.1 The Diagnosis: Dukkha and the Cycle of Samsara

## 2.1 診斷：苦與輪迴

The starting point for all Buddhist thought is the recognition of Dukkha (Pali) or Duḥkha (Sanskrit). This term is often translated as "suffering," but its meaning is far more comprehensive, encompassing deeper concepts of "unease," "stress," "anxiety," and "pervasive unsatisfactoriness".

所有佛教思想的起點是對「苦」（巴利語 Dukkha，梵語 Duḥkha）的認識。這個詞常被譯為「suffering」（痛苦），但其含義要廣泛得多，包含了「不安」、「壓力」、「焦慮」和「普遍的不圓滿」等更深層次的概念。

Dukkha is not an anomaly or a punishment, but a fundamental and inescapable characteristic of all conditioned existence. It is the First of the Four Noble Truths, the foundational teaching of the Buddha.

「苦」並非異常現象或懲罰，而是所有有為法（conditioned existence）一個根本且不可避免的特徵。它是佛陀基本教義「四聖諦」中的第一諦。

Buddhist philosophy categorizes Dukkha into three distinct types to illustrate its pervasive nature:

佛教哲學將「苦」分為三種不同類型，以說明其普遍性：

1. Dukkha-dukkha (The Suffering of Suffering): This is the most obvious form of suffering, encompassing the physical and mental pain that all beings experience: birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, grief, and despair. It is the overt pain and discomfort of life.

- 苦苦（Dukkha-dukkha）：這是最明顯的痛苦形式，包括所有眾生所經歷的身心痛苦：生、老、病、死、愁、悲、絕望。它是生命中顯而易見的痛苦與不適。

2. Viparinama-dukkha (The Suffering of Change): This refers to a more subtle form of suffering that arises from the impermanence (anitya) of all things. Even pleasant experiences are a source of Dukkha because they are transient and inevitably come to an end, leading to dissatisfaction and the fear of loss. The happiness derived from conditioned things is unreliable and therefore unsatisfactory.

- 壞苦（Viparinama-dukkha）：這指的是一種更微妙的痛苦形式，源於萬物的無常性（anitya）。即使是愉快的經歷也是「苦」的來源，因為它們是短暫的，終將結束，從而導致不滿足和對失去的恐懼。從有為法中獲得的快樂是不可靠的，因此是不圓滿的。

3. Sankhara-dukkha (The Suffering of Conditioned Existence): This is the most profound and subtle category of Dukkha. It points to the inherent unsatisfactoriness of existence itself, which is composed of conditioned and interdependent phenomena (sankhara). Because all things, including the self, are impermanent and lack any fixed, independent essence, there is a background hum of existential unease and a sense that things are "not quite right".

 - 行苦（Sankhara-dukkha）：這是最深刻、最微妙的一類「苦」。它指向存在本身固有的不圓滿性，而存在是由有為且相互依存的現象（sankhara，行）所構成。因為包括自我在內的一切事物都是無常的，缺乏任何固定、獨立的本質，所以存在著一種存在性不安的背景雜音，以及一種「事事不對勁」的感覺。

This universal condition of Dukkha is perpetuated by Samsara, a Sanskrit term meaning "wandering through".

這種普遍的「苦」的狀態由「輪迴」（Samsara）所延續，這是一個梵語詞，意為「流浪經歷」。

Samsara is the beginningless, aimless, and repetitive cycle of birth, death, and rebirth in which all unenlightened beings are trapped. Rebirth can occur in various realms, from hellish states to heavenly ones, but all are temporary and ultimately marked by Dukkha.

輪迴是無始、無目的、重複的生死循環，所有未覺悟的眾生都被困在其中。重生可能發生在各種界域，從地獄到天界，但所有界域都是暫時的，並最終以「苦」為標誌。

The engine that drives the wheel of Samsara is a combination of ignorance (avidyā) and craving (taṇhā). Avidyā is the fundamental ignorance of the true nature of reality—specifically, ignorance of the truths of impermanence, suffering, and non-self (Anatta). This ignorance leads to taṇhā, which is the thirst, craving, or attachment to sense pleasures, to continued existence, and even to the annihilation of existence. This craving, rooted in a mistaken belief in a permanent self that needs to be gratified and protected, generates karma—the law of cause and effect—which dictates the conditions of future rebirths and keeps the cycle of suffering in motion.

驅動輪迴之輪的引擎是無明（avidyā）和渴愛（taṇhā）的結合。無明是對實相本質的根本無知——特別是對無常、苦和無我（Anatta）真理的無知。這種無知導致了渴愛，即對感官享樂、對持續存在，甚至對存在之毀滅的渴望、貪求或執著。這種渴愛植根於對一個需要被滿足和保護的永恆自我的錯誤信念，它產生了業（karma）——因果法則——這決定了未來重生的條件，並使苦的循環持續運轉。

The Buddhist diagnosis of the human problem is therefore fundamentally different from the Christian one. It is not a legal or relational problem rooted in disobedience to a personal God. Instead, it is an ontological and epistemological problem. The problem is ontological because Dukkha is presented as an inherent feature of conditioned existence itself, not as a punishment for a specific past event. The problem is epistemological because its root cause is identified as avidyā—a cognitive error, a fundamental misperception of reality. It is also a psychological problem, as this misperception fuels the destructive emotions of craving and aversion. The Buddhist problem is impersonal; it is not about being guilty before a divine Person, but about being trapped in a flawed, self-perpetuating system of existence due to a deep-seated misunderstanding of how that system operates.

因此，佛教對人類問題的診斷與基督教的診斷有著根本的不同。它不是一個植根於對有位格上帝不順從的法律或關係問題。相反，它是一個本體論和認識論的問題。這個問題是本體論的，因為「苦」被呈現為有為法本身的一個固有特徵，而不是對某一特定過去事件的懲罰。這個問題是認識論的，因為其根本原因被確定為無明——一種認知錯誤，一種對實相的根本誤解。它也是一個心理問題，因為這種誤解助長了渴愛和厭惡的破壞性情緒。佛教的問題是非個人性的；它不是關於在一位神聖位格面前有罪，而是關於由於對一個有缺陷、自我延續的存在系統如何運作的根深蒂固的誤解，而被困在其中。

## 2.2 The Prescription: The Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path

## 2.2 處方：四聖諦與八正道

In response to the diagnosis of Dukkha, the Buddha's teaching, known as the Dharma, provides a clear and methodical prescription for its cure. This prescription is not a set of divine revelations or commandments to be accepted on blind faith, but a pragmatic and therapeutic regimen to be understood, practiced, and verified through personal experience. The core of this prescription is encapsulated in the Four Noble Truths.

針對「苦」的診斷，佛陀的教法，即「法」（Dharma），為其療癒提供了一個清晰而系統的處方。這個處方並非一套需要盲目信仰接受的神聖啟示或誡命，而是一個需要通過個人經驗來理解、實踐和驗證的務實治療方案。這個處方的核心概括在四聖諦之中。

The Four Noble Truths are structured like a medical diagnosis:

四聖諦的結構就像一個醫學診斷：

1. The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha): The diagnosis of the illness. Life in Samsara is inherently characterized by suffering and unsatisfactoriness.

- 苦諦（Dukkha）：疾病的診斷。輪迴中的生命本質上以痛苦和不圓滿為特徵。

2. The Truth of the Origin of Suffering (Samudāya): Identifying the cause of the illness. The cause of Dukkha is craving (taṇhā), which is born from ignorance (avidyā).

- 集諦（Samudāya）：確定疾病的原因。苦的起因是渴愛（taṇhā），它源於無明（avidyā）。

3. The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Nirodha): The prognosis, confirming a cure is possible. It is possible to end Dukkha by completely eradicating craving. This cessation is Nirvana.

- 滅諦（Nirodha）：預後，確認治癒是可能的。通過徹底根除渴愛，可以終結苦。這種止息就是涅槃。

4. The Truth of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering (Magga): The prescription for the cure. The way to end suffering is to follow the Noble Eightfold Path.

- 道諦（Magga）：治癒的處方。終結痛苦的方法是遵循八正道。

The Noble Eightfold Path is the practical application of the Fourth Noble Truth, a comprehensive system of self-cultivation designed to reorient one's entire being toward liberation. It is often called the "Middle Way" because it avoids the extremes of sensual indulgence and severe asceticism. The path is not a linear sequence of steps but a set of eight interconnected factors that are to be developed simultaneously. These eight factors are traditionally grouped into three main divisions, known as the Three Higher Trainings:

八正道是第四聖諦的實際應用，是一個旨在將個人整個生命重新導向解脫的全面自我修行體系。它常被稱為「中道」，因為它避免了縱慾和嚴酷苦行的兩個極端。這條道路並非線性的步驟序列，而是一組需要同時發展的、相互關聯的八個因素。這八個因素傳統上被分為三個主要部分，稱為三增上學：

1. Ethical Conduct (Sila): This forms the foundation of the path and includes Right Speech (avoiding lies, slander, harsh speech), Right Action (avoiding killing, stealing, sexual misconduct), and Right Livelihood (engaging in work that does not harm others).46 The practice of Sila purifies one's actions and creates the mental tranquility and lack of remorse necessary for deeper concentration.

- 戒學（Sila）：這構成了道的基礎，包括正語（避免謊言、誹謗、惡語）、正業（避免殺生、偷盜、邪淫）和正命（從事不傷害他人的工作）。戒的修習淨化人的行為，並為更深的禪定創造必要的心理寧靜和無悔。

2. Mental Discipline (Samadhi): This division focuses on training the mind and includes Right Effort (cultivating wholesome states and preventing unwholesome ones), Right Mindfulness (sati, maintaining present-moment awareness of body, feelings, and mind), and Right Concentration (developing deep states of meditative absorption, or dhyana).The practice of Samadhi leads to a calm, stable, and powerful mind, capable of penetrating insight.

- 定學（Samadhi）：這部分專注於訓練心靈，包括正精進（培育善的狀態並防止不善的狀態）、正念（sati，保持對身體、感受和心念的當下覺知）和正定（發展深度的禪定狀態，即 dhyana）。定的修習能帶來一個平靜、穩定且強大的心靈，能夠產生穿透性的洞察力。

3. Wisdom (Prajna): This is the culmination of the path and includes Right Understanding (correctly grasping the Four Noble Truths and the nature of reality, especially the doctrines of impermanence, suffering, and non-self) and Right Intent (the resolve to renounce craving, ill will, and cruelty). Prajna is the direct, experiential insight that cuts through ignorance at its root and leads to liberation.

- 慧學（Prajna）：這是道的頂峰，包括正見（正確地理解四聖諦和實相的本質，特別是無常、苦和無我的教義）和正思維（決心捨棄貪欲、惡意和殘忍）。般若（Prajna）是直接的、體驗性的洞見，它從根本上斬斷無明，引向解脫。

The Buddhist path is thus a structured, self-powered program of ethical purification, mental training, and wisdom cultivation. It is a journey of transformation undertaken by the individual for the sake of their own liberation from suffering.

因此，佛教之道是一個結構化的、依靠自力的道德淨化、心智訓練和智慧培養的程序。這是一趟由個人為從痛苦中解脫而進行的轉化之旅。

## 2.3 The Guide: The Buddha as Teacher and the Role of Dharma

## 2.3 指引者：佛陀作為導師與法的角色

In the Buddhist soteriological framework, the role of the founder, Siddhartha Gautama, is fundamentally different from that of a divine savior. He is not a god, nor an incarnation of a god, but an extraordinary human being who, through his own strenuous effort, awakened to the ultimate truth of reality. The title "Buddha" is not a personal name but an epithet meaning "the Awakened One" or "the Enlightened One".

在佛教的解脫論框架中，創始人釋迦牟尼·喬達摩的角色與神聖救主的角色有著根本的不同。他不是神，也不是神的化身，而是一位非凡的人類，他通過自身艱苦的努力，覺悟了實相的終極真理。「佛陀」這個稱號並非個人名字，而是一個意為「覺醒者」或「開悟者」的頭銜。

The Buddha's primary role is that of a teacher and a guide. Having discovered the path to liberation himself, he taught it to others out of great compassion, so that they too could free themselves from suffering. He is revered as the supreme example that liberation is possible for human beings through their own efforts. His life story—from his renunciation of worldly pleasure to his years of ascetic practice and final enlightenment under the Bodhi tree—serves as a blueprint for the spiritual seeker.

佛陀的主要角色是導師和指引者。在他自己發現解脫之道後，他出於大悲心將其教導給他人，以便他們也能從痛苦中解脫出來。他被尊為人類可以通過自身努力實現解脫的最高典範。他的人生故事——從他放棄世俗享樂到多年的苦行修煉，再到在菩提樹下的最終開悟——為靈性追求者提供了一個藍圖。

Crucially, the Buddha explicitly disclaimed the role of a personal savior who could rescue beings through his own power or grace. His final words are reported to have been, "All conditioned things are subject to decay. Strive on with diligence." This places the responsibility for liberation squarely on the shoulders of the individual practitioner. The Buddha can point the way, but each person must walk the path themselves. As one analysis notes, "he claims to be not a personal savior who can rescue beings from suffering by his unique power but a teacher who can instruct us in the way to deliverance".

至關重要的是，佛陀明確否認了自己作為一個能夠憑藉自身力量或恩典拯救眾生的個人救主的角色。據記載，他的遺言是：「諸行無常，精進不懈。」這將解脫的責任完全放在了個體修行者的肩上。佛陀可以指出道路，但每個人都必須親自走上這條路。正如一份分析指出的：「他聲稱自己並非能憑藉其獨特力量將眾生從苦難中解救出來的個人救主，而是一位能教導我們解脫之道的老師」。

Therefore, the true "savior" in Buddhism is the Dharma—the truth he discovered and the path he taught. The Dharma is presented as a universal law, like the law of gravity, which the Buddha did not invent but merely rediscovered. The emphasis is consistently on "knowing and seeing for oneself" (ehipassiko, meaning "inviting one to come and see"). The famous Kalama Sutta advises against accepting teachings based on scripture, tradition, or the authority of a teacher alone, but to test them against one's own experience and adopt what leads to welfare and happiness. Faith in Buddhism is not belief in a person's atoning power, but rather a trusting confidence in the path and the guide who has successfully walked it, a confidence that must ultimately be validated by personal realization.

因此，佛教中真正的「救主」是「法」——他所發現的真理和他所教導的道路。「法」被呈現為一條普適法則，就像萬有引力定律一樣，佛陀並未發明它，只是重新發現了它。重點始終在於「親知親見」（ehipassiko，意為「歡迎前來親見」）。著名的《卡拉瑪經》建議不要僅僅基於經文、傳統或老師的權威來接受教義，而是要用自己的經驗來檢驗它們，並採納那些能帶來福祉和快樂的教義。佛教中的信心並非相信某人的贖罪能力，而是對那條道路以及成功走過那條路的指引者的一種信賴，這種信賴最終必須通過個人的親證來加以驗證。

## 2.4 The Ultimate Telos: Nirvana and the Cessation of Being

## 2.4 終極目標：涅槃與存在的止息

The ultimate goal of the Buddhist path, the final and complete liberation from Dukkha and Samsara, is Nirvana (Pali: Nibbana). The word literally means "to blow out," "to quench," or "to extinguish," as one would extinguish a flame. This is the Third Noble Truth, the cessation of suffering.

佛教之道的最終目標，即從「苦」和輪迴中最終、徹底的解脫，是涅槃（巴利語：Nibbana）。這個詞的字面意思是「吹滅」、「熄滅」或「撲滅」，就像熄滅火焰一樣。這就是第三聖諦，苦的止息。

What, precisely, is extinguished in Nirvana? It is the "three fires" or "three poisons" that fuel the cycle of rebirth: greed (raga), aversion (dvesha), and ignorance (moha or avidyā). With the complete uprooting of these defilements, the craving (taṇhā) that drives existence ceases. The fires of attachment and clinging are quenched, and the being is no longer subject to the karmic forces that lead to future births. This is the release from the wheel of Samsara.

在涅槃中，究竟是什麼被熄滅了？是驅動重生循環的「三火」或「三毒」：貪（raga）、瞋（dvesha）和痴（moha 或 avidyā）。隨著這些煩惱的徹底根除，驅動存在的渴愛（taṇhā）也隨之止息。執著和固守的火焰被熄滅，生命體不再受導致未來重生的業力所束縛。這就是從輪迴之輪中解脫。

At the heart of this process is the profound and transformative insight into the doctrine of Anatta, or non-self. This is perhaps the most distinctive and radical teaching of Buddhism. It asserts that there is no permanent, unchanging, independent soul, self, or "I" at the core of a being. What we perceive as a "self" is merely a temporary, interdependent aggregation of five fluctuating components (skandhas): form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. The belief in a solid, enduring self is the primary illusion born of ignorance, and it is this illusory self that craves, clings, and suffers. Liberation, therefore, is not the salvation of the self, but liberation from the very idea of the self. Nirvana is the direct realization of this truth of emptiness (sunyata) and non-self.

這一過程的核心，是對「無我」（Anatta）教義的深刻且具轉化性的洞見。這或許是佛教最獨特、最激進的教義。它主張在一個生命體的核心，沒有永恆、不變、獨立的靈魂、自我或「我」。我們所感知的「自我」，僅僅是五個變動不居的組成部分（五蘊，skandhas）的暫時、相互依存的聚合體：色、受、想、行、識。相信存在一個堅實、持久的自我是由無明產生的首要幻覺，而正是這個虛幻的自我渴望、執著並受苦。因此，解脫不是自我的拯救，而是從自我這個觀念本身中解脫出來。涅槃就是對空性（sunyata）和無我這一真理的直接證悟。

Buddhist tradition distinguishes between two types of Nirvana:

佛教傳統區分兩種涅槃：

1. Sopadhishesa-nirvana ("Nirvana with remainder"): This is the state of liberation attained by an enlightened being (Arhat or Buddha) during their lifetime. The fires of greed, hatred, and ignorance are extinguished, but the "remainder" of the five aggregates, the mind-body complex, continues to exist until the end of that life, sustained by the residue of past karma. The enlightened person is free from mental suffering but may still experience physical pain.

- 有餘依涅槃（Sopadhishesa-nirvana）：這是一位開悟者（阿羅漢或佛陀）在生前達到的解脫狀態。貪、瞋、痴之火已被熄滅，但五蘊的「餘依」，即身心複合體，在過去業力的殘餘支持下，會繼續存在直到該生命結束。開悟者已從精神痛苦中解脫，但可能仍會經歷身體上的痛苦。

2. Parinirvana ("Nirvana without remainder" or final Nirvana): This occurs at the physical death of an Arhat or Buddha. With no craving left to generate new karma, the chain of cause and effect is broken. The five aggregates that constitute the "person" completely dissolve and are never reconstituted in any form of rebirth.

- 無餘依涅槃（Parinirvana）或般涅槃：這發生在阿羅漢或佛陀肉體死亡之時。由於沒有渴愛來產生新的業，因果鏈被打破。構成「個人」的五蘊完全消解，並且再也不會以任何形式的重生而重新組合。

The question of what happens to an enlightened being after death—whether they exist or do not exist—is considered an "unanswerable question" in early Buddhism. The Buddha compared it to asking where a flame goes when it is extinguished. The flame has not gone north, south, east, or west; it has simply ceased to be because its sustaining conditions (fuel, oxygen) have been removed. Similarly, the "person" who attains parinirvana does not go to a place; the psycho-physical processes that constitute their being have simply ceased.

在早期佛教中，關於一位開悟者死後會發生什麼——他們是存在還是不存在——被認為是一個「無記問」（無法回答的問題）。佛陀將其比作問火焰熄滅後去了哪裡。火焰沒有去往東南西北任何方向；它只是因為其賴以存在的條件（燃料、氧氣）被移除了而停止存在。同樣地，達到般涅槃的「人」並不是去到某個地方；構成其存在的心理-物理過程只是停止了。

The Buddhist telos, therefore, represents a soteriological strategy of dissolution, not perfection. The problem, Dukkha, is fundamentally rooted in the craving and clinging of what is perceived to be a self. The core insight of the path, prajna, is the realization that this self is an illusion (Anatta). The path itself is a methodical deconstruction of this illusion and the extinguishing of all desires associated with it. The final goal, Nirvana, is the complete "blowing out" of this illusory self. Buddhism does not solve the self's problem; it solves the problem by demonstrating that the self is the problem. Ultimate liberation is not freedom for the self, but freedom from the self. This is a goal of impersonal cessation, the radical antithesis of the Christian hope for personal immortality.

因此，佛教的終極目標代表了一種消解的解脫策略，而非圓滿。問題，「苦」，從根本上植根於被感知為自我的那個東西的渴愛與執著。道的的核心洞見，般若（prajna），是體悟到這個自我是個幻覺（無我，Anatta）。道本身就是對這一幻覺的系統性解構，以及熄滅與之相關的所有慾望。最終目標，涅槃，是這個虛幻自我的徹底「吹滅」。佛教並非解決自我的問題；它是通過證明自我就是問題所在來解決這個問題。終極解脫不是為自我爭取自由，而是從自我中獲得自由。這是一個非個人性止息的目標，與基督教對個人永生的盼望形成了徹底的對立。

# Part III: A Direct Comparative Theological Analysis

# 第三部分：直接的比較神學分析

While Christianity and Buddhism both address the fundamental human quest for an ultimate resolution to the problem of existence, a direct comparison reveals that they operate from profoundly different, and often antithetical, assumptions about reality, the human condition, the means of resolution, and the final goal. Their soteriological systems are not merely different paths to the same mountaintop; they are paths leading to entirely different destinations, built upon mutually exclusive metaphysical foundations.

儘管基督教和佛教都致力於解決人類對存在問題終極答案的基本探求，但直接比較顯示，它們在關於實相、人類狀況、解決途徑及最終目標的假設上，存在著深刻的差異，且常常相互對立。它們的救贖論體系不僅僅是通往同一座山頂的不同路徑；它們是建立在相互排斥的形而上學基礎之上，引向完全不同終點的路徑。

| 最終狀態                    | 個人存在的完美：個體在復活的身體中得榮耀並被永恆保存。                                                                                                      | 個人存在的止息：個體身份被徹底且永久地消解。                                                                                                                        |

## 3.1 Foundational Problem: Moral Guilt (Sin) vs. Existential Unsatisfactoriness (Dukkha)

## 3.1 根本問題：道德罪責（罪）vs. 存在性不圓滿（苦）

The starting points of the two traditions define their entire trajectories. The Christian diagnosis is one of Sin, a concept that is intrinsically moral and relational. Sin is not merely a mistake or ignorance; it is a willful transgression against the revealed law of a holy and personal God. It has a specific historical origin in the Fall of Adam, an event that transmitted a state of legal guilt and moral corruption to all of humanity. The problem is that humanity is culpable, deserving of punishment, and alienated from its Creator. This framework is inherently personal and dramatic, involving concepts of law, justice, rebellion, and reconciliation.

這兩個傳統的起點決定了它們的整個軌跡。基督教的診斷是「罪」，一個本質上是道德性和關係性的概念。罪不僅僅是一個錯誤或無知；它是對一位聖潔、有位格的上帝所啟示律法的蓄意違背。它有一個特定的歷史起源，即亞當的墮落，這一事件將法律上的罪責和道德上的敗壞狀態傳給了全人類。問題在於人類是有罪的，應受懲罰，並且與其造物主疏遠。這個框架本質上是個人化和戲劇性的，涉及法律、公義、背叛和和解等概念。

In stark contrast, the Buddhist diagnosis is Dukkha, a concept that is existential and psychological. Dukkha is not a moral failing but a universal and impersonal condition, a fundamental feature of conditioned existence itself.39 It has no specific historical starting point but is a characteristic of the beginningless cycle of Samsara. Its cause is not willful rebellion but ignorance (avidyā) of the way things truly are, which in turn fuels craving (taṇhā). The karmic law that perpetuates this cycle is an impersonal principle of cause and effect, akin to a law of nature, not a system of divine judgment or moral praise and blame. Therefore, the problem is not that one is guilty, but that one is trapped in a painful, unsatisfactory state of being due to a cognitive and psychological error.  

與此形成鮮明對比的是，佛教的診斷是「苦」（Dukkha），一個存在性和心理性的概念。「苦」不是道德上的失敗，而是一種普遍且非個人性的狀態，是有為法本身的一個基本特徵。它沒有特定的歷史起點，而是無始輪迴的一個特徵。
其原因不是蓄意的背叛，而是對事物真實樣貌的無知（avidyā），這又反過來助長了渴愛（taṇhā）。延續這一循環的業力法則是非個人性的因果原則，類似於自然法則，而不是神聖審判或道德褒貶的體系。因此，問題不在於人有罪，而在於人因認知和心理上的錯誤而被困在一個痛苦、不圓滿的存在狀態中。

## 3.2 Soteriological Mechanism: Other-Power (Grace) vs. Self-Power (Effort)

## 3.2 救贖機制：他力（恩典）vs. 自力（努力）

This difference in diagnosis leads directly to a difference in the proposed mechanism for resolution. Because Christianity views humanity as spiritually dead and helpless in its sin, salvation must be an act of Other-Power—specifically, the grace of God. Humans cannot earn or achieve their own salvation; it must be given to them as a free gift from an external, divine source. The entire system is predicated on the idea that God does for humanity what it cannot do for itself. The notion of divine grace is central to Christian theology, representing the unmerited favor and power of God intervening to save.

這種診斷上的差異直接導致了解決機制的差異。因為基督教視人類在罪中是靈性死亡且無助的，所以救贖必須是一種他力（Other-Power）的行為——具體來說，是上帝的恩典。人類無法賺取或實現自己的救贖；它必須作為一份來自外部神聖源頭的免費禮物賜予他們。整個體系都基於這樣一個觀念：上帝為人類做了人類自己無法做到的事。神聖恩典的概念是基督教神學的核心，代表上帝為拯救而介入的不配得的恩惠與大能。

Buddhism, lacking a concept of a creator God to intervene, necessarily posits a path of Self-Power. Since the problem is rooted in one's own ignorance and craving, the solution must come from cultivating one's own wisdom and discipline. Liberation is a process of self-purification and self-realization achieved through the rigorous practice of the Noble Eightfold Path. The Buddha taught a path of self-reliance, instructing his followers to be "a lamp unto themselves." While the Buddha's teachings are an indispensable guide, the effort must be personal. The concept of unmerited grace from a deity is inadmissible in orthodox Theravada Buddhism, as no god can interfere with the impersonal law of karma.

佛教由於缺乏一個可以介入的造物主上帝的概念，必然提出一條自力（Self-Power）的道路。既然問題根植於自身的無明和渴愛，解決方案就必須來自於培養自身的智慧和紀律。解脫是通過嚴格修習八正道來實現自我淨化和自我證悟的過程。佛陀教導了一條自力更生的道路，指示他的追隨者要「做自己的明燈」。雖然佛陀的教導是不可或缺的指引，但努力必須是個人的。在正統的上座部佛教中，來自神祇的不配得的恩典這一概念是不可接受的，因為沒有任何神可以干預非個人性的業力法則。

It is noteworthy that some schools of Mahayana Buddhism, particularly Pure Land Buddhism, developed a concept that is functionally analogous to grace. Recognizing the extreme difficulty of the path of self-effort, this tradition teaches that one can be reborn in the "Pure Land" of Amitabha Buddha not through one's own merit, but by relying on the "other-power" of Amitabha's vow, which is accessed through faith and recitation of his name. This internal development within Buddhism provides a fascinating parallel to the Christian emphasis on grace, yet it remains a distinct path within the broader Buddhist landscape and does not alter the fundamental non-theistic premise of the tradition as a whole.

值得注意的是，一些大乘佛教宗派，特別是淨土宗，發展出了一個在功能上類似於恩典的概念。該傳統認識到自力修行的極度困難，教導說人可以往生阿彌陀佛的「淨土」，不是憑藉自己的功德，而是依靠阿彌陀佛願力的「他力」，通過信願和念誦其名號來獲得。佛教內部的這一發展為基督教對恩典的強調提供了一個有趣的平行，但它在更廣泛的佛教版圖中仍是一條獨特的道路，並未改變整個傳統的根本非有神論前提。

## 3.3 The Central Figure: The Divine Savior vs. The Enlightened Teacher

## 3.3 中心人物：神聖救主 vs. 開悟導師

The roles of Jesus Christ and Siddhartha Gautama are direct reflections of their respective soteriological mechanisms. Jesus is the Divine Savior. His identity as God incarnate is essential to his function. His death is not merely an example of selfless love but a unique, cosmic event of atonement that reconciles the world to God. He is the agent of salvation, the one who pays the price for sin. He does not merely point to the way; He declares, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" John 14:6. Salvation is found in Him and through Him. The central icon of Christianity—the crucifixion of God—powerfully symbolizes this belief in a saving act performed by a divine being for humanity.

耶穌基督和釋迦牟尼·喬達摩的角色直接反映了他們各自的救贖機制。耶穌是神聖的救主。祂作為道成肉身的上帝這一身份對其功能至關重要。祂的死不僅僅是無私之愛的典範，更是一個使世界與上帝和解的、獨一無二的宇宙性贖罪事件。祂是救贖的施行者，是為罪付上代價的那一位。祂不僅僅是指出道路；祂宣告說：「我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉着我，沒有人能到父那裡去。」（約翰福音 14:6）。救恩在祂裡面，並藉著祂而得。基督教的中心象徵——上帝被釘十字架——有力地象徵了這一信念，即一位神聖存在為人類所行的拯救之舉。

The Buddha, conversely, is the Enlightened Teacher. His identity as a human being is essential to his function. He serves as the ultimate proof that a human, through personal effort, can achieve liberation. He did not atone for the karma of others; rather, he discovered and taught the Dharma—the path by which individuals can purify their own karma. He is the guide, not the savior. He points to the path and encourages others to walk it for themselves. The central icon of Buddhism—a serene, meditating sage who passed away peacefully at an old age—symbolizes this belief in a path of wisdom and self-realization that any human can follow.

相反，佛陀是開悟的導師。他作為人類的身份對其功能至關重要。他作為一個人類可以通過個人努力實現解脫的終極證明。他沒有為他人的業力贖罪；相反，他發現並教導了「法」——個體可以藉此淨化自身業力的道路。他是導師，不是救主。他指出道路，並鼓勵他人親自去走。佛教的中心象徵——一位安詳、冥想的聖人，在晚年平靜地去世——象徵了這一信念，即任何人都可遵循一條智慧和自我證悟的道路。

## 3.4 The Final Goal: Personal Immortality (Heaven) vs. Impersonal Extinction (Nirvana)

## 3.4 最終目標：個人永生（天堂）vs. 非個人性寂滅（涅槃）

Finally, the ultimate goals of the two traditions are not just different; they are antithetical. The Christian goal is Heaven, understood as eternal life. This is the perfection and eternal preservation of the individual person in a state of joyful, conscious communion with a personal God and with other redeemed individuals. It is a state of fulfilled being, where the most fundamental desires of the human heart for love, relationship, and purpose are perfectly and eternally satisfied in God. The doctrine of the resurrection of the body further affirms the eternal value and reality of the individual in all his or her embodied particularity.

最後，這兩個傳統的終極目標不僅僅是不同；它們是相互對立的。基督教的目標是天堂，被理解為永生。這是在與有位格的上帝以及其他被救贖的個體喜樂、有意識的相交狀態中，個體人格的完善與永恆保存。這是一個圓滿存在的狀態，在這裡，人心對愛、關係和目的最根本的渴望在上帝裡面得到完美且永恆的滿足。身體復活的教義進一步肯定了個體在其所有具體化身中的永恆價值和真實性。

The Buddhist goal is Nirvana, the "extinguishing" of the flame of personal existence. It is the cessation of the craving and ignorance that cause suffering and rebirth. Since the concept of an enduring, personal self (Anatta) is considered an illusion at the root of suffering, the final liberation, parinirvana, entails the complete and irreversible dissolution of that individual identity. It is a state of desirelessness, not desire-fulfillment; a state of ultimate peace that comes from the cessation of being, not the perfection of being. It is not a place where one goes, but the end of the process of "going." While described as "ultimate happiness," it is the happiness of release from the burden of existence, not the joy of continued existence. Thus, Heaven affirms the ultimate reality and goodness of the person, while Nirvana denies it.

佛教的目標是涅槃，即個人存在之火焰的「熄滅」。它是導致痛苦和重生的渴愛與無明的止息。由於持久的、個人的自我（無我，Anatta）這一概念被認為是痛苦根源處的幻覺，最終的解脫，即般涅槃，必然導致該個體身份的徹底且不可逆轉的消解。這是一種無欲的狀態，而非慾望的滿足；是一種來自存在止息的終極平靜，而非存在的圓滿。它不是一個人去往的地方，而是「去往」這一過程的終結。雖然被描述為「究竟之樂」，但它是從存在的重負中解脫出來的快樂，而不是持續存在的喜悅。因此，天堂肯定了個人的終極實在性和美善，而涅槃則否定了它。

# Part IV: Synthesis & Concluding Insights

# 第四部分：綜合與結論性洞見

The profound differences in the soteriological systems of Christianity and Buddhism are not arbitrary or superficial. They are the logical and necessary consequences of the foundational worldviews, or metaphysical starting points, of each religion. Understanding this deep-seated metaphysical divide is crucial for appreciating why their paths to "salvation" are not merely different but are, in fact, directed toward fundamentally irreconcilable ends.

基督教與佛教救贖體系的深刻差異並非隨意或膚淺的。它們是各自宗教的基礎世界觀，或形而上學起點的邏輯和必然結果。理解這一根深蒂固的形而上學分歧，對於領會為何它們通往「救贖」的道路不僅僅是不同，而且事實上是朝著根本無法調和的終點而去，至關重要。
## 4.1 The Metaphysical Divide: Theism and Non-theism as Irreconcilable Frameworks

## 4.1 形而上學的鴻溝：有神論與非有神論作為不可調和的框架

The ultimate source of the divergence between Christian and Buddhist soteriology is the chasm between theism and non-theism.

基督教與佛教救贖論分歧的最終根源，在於有神論與非有神論之間的鴻溝。

Christianity is fundamentally theistic. Its entire worldview is built upon the existence of a single, personal, transcendent, and omnipotent Creator God who is the source of all reality and moral value. This single premise generates the entire Christian soteriological structure as a matter of logical necessity. If a personal God creates humanity for relationship, then the ultimate problem must be a rupture in that relationship, which is defined as Sin. If God is holy and just, this sin incurs a legal debt and moral guilt. If humanity is finite and fallen, it cannot repay this infinite debt, necessitating an intervention from the divine side: Grace. This grace is manifested in the person of a Divine Savior, God Himself incarnate, whose sacrificial act of Atonement satisfies justice and enables reconciliation. The means of accessing this is Faith, a relational act of trust. The final goal is the restoration of the original purpose: Heaven, a state of eternal, personal relationship with God. Every element of the Christian path is a direct consequence of its theistic foundation.

基督教根本上是有神論的。它的整個世界觀建立在一位獨一、有位格、超然且全能的造物主上帝的存在之上，祂是所有實相和道德價值的源頭。這單一前提作為一個邏輯必然，催生了整個基督教的救贖論結構。如果一位有位格的上帝為建立關係而創造人類，那麼終極問題必然是那段關係的破裂，這被定義為「罪」。如果上帝是聖潔和公義的，這個罪就會招致法律上的債務和道德上的罪責。如果人類是有限且墮落的，它就無法償還這筆無限的債務，這就需要來自神聖一方的干預：恩典。這份恩典體現在一位神聖救主的位格中，即道成肉身的上帝自己，祂的贖罪祭滿足了公義並促成了和解。獲取這一恩典的途徑是信心，一種關係性的信靠行為。最終目標是恢復最初的目的：天堂，一種與上帝永恆的、個人的關係狀態。基督教道路的每一個元素都是其有神論基礎的直接結果。

Buddhism, in its core expression, is non-theistic. It does not posit a creator God and views speculation about ultimate origins as irrelevant to the task of liberation. This foundational absence necessitates its entire soteriological framework. In a universe without a divine lawgiver, there can be no "sin" in the Christian sense. The fundamental problem must therefore be an impersonal feature of existence itself: Dukkha. In a universe without a divine savior, there can be no external "grace." The path to liberation must therefore be one of self-effort, a Self-Powered journey of discipline and insight. The central figure cannot be a savior but must be a Human Teacher who exemplifies the possibility of this journey. Since the problem is rooted in the clinging and craving of a "self" in a transient world, the ultimate solution must be the realization that the self is an illusion (Anatta) and the final goal must be the Extinction (Nirvana) of this illusion and its attendant suffering.

佛教在其核心表達中是非有神論的。它不設定一位造物主上帝，並認為對終極起源的思辨與解脫的任務無關。這種基礎性的缺失使其整個救贖論框架成為必然。在一個沒有神聖立法者的宇宙中，不可能有基督教意義上的「罪」。因此，根本問題必然是存在本身的一個非個人性特徵：「苦」。在一個沒有神聖救主的宇宙中，不可能有外在的「恩典」。因此，解脫之道必然是一條自我努力的道路，一條自力的、關於紀律與洞見的旅程。中心人物不可能是救主，而必須是一位例證了這趟旅程可能的人類導師。既然問題根植於一個短暫世界中「自我」的執著和渴愛，終極解決方案必然是體悟到自我是一種幻覺（無我），而最終目標必然是這種幻覺及其伴隨痛苦的寂滅（涅槃）。

The two systems are internally coherent and logically consistent, but they are built upon mutually exclusive metaphysical foundations. The choice between them is not simply a matter of preferring one set of ethics or practices over another; it is a choice between two fundamentally different conceptions of reality itself.

這兩個體系內部連貫且邏輯一致，但它們建立在相互排斥的形而上學基礎之上。在它們之間做出選擇，不僅僅是偏好一套倫理或實踐而非另一套的問題；這是在兩種對實相本身根本不同的概念之間做出選擇。

## 4.2 Implications for Lived Experience, Ethics, and Ultimate Hope

## 4.2 對生活體驗、倫理和終極盼望的影響

These divergent frameworks have profound implications for the lived experience, ethical orientation, and ultimate hope of their adherents.

這些分歧的框架對其信徒的生活體驗、倫理取向和終極盼望有著深遠的影響。

For the Christian, life is lived in the context of a personal relationship with God. Ethics are rooted in obedience to a divine lawgiver and, more deeply, in love for a personal God who first loved them. The Ten Commandments, for example, are understood as divine commands that reflect God's own holy character. The ultimate hope is deeply personal and relational: the resurrection of the body and the joyful reunion with God and with loved ones in a perfected, eternal kingdom. It is a hope centered on the fulfillment and glorification of personal existence.

對於基督徒來說，生命是在與上帝的個人關係背景下度過的。倫理植根於對一位神聖立法者的順服，更深層次地，植根於對那位先愛了他們的有位格上帝的愛。例如，十誡被理解為反映上帝自身聖潔品格的神聖命令。終極的盼望是深度的個人性和關係性的：身體的復活以及在一個完美的、永恆的國度裡與上帝和摯愛的親人喜樂地重逢。這是一個以個人存在的實現和得榮耀為中心的盼望。

For the Buddhist, life is a training ground for the mind. Ethics, such as the Five Precepts, are not divine commands but pragmatic, voluntary undertakings designed to purify the mind, reduce harm, and create the conditions for successful meditation. They are skillful means to an end, not ends in themselves. The ultimate hope is for release—the final cessation of the painful, wearisome cycle of personal existence and the extinguishing of the flame of individual consciousness. It is a hope centered on the final and complete liberation from the burdens of personhood.

對於佛教徒來說，生命是心靈的訓練場。倫理，例如五戒，不是神的命令，而是務實的、自願的承諾，旨在淨化心靈、減少傷害，並為成功的禪修創造條件。它們是達成目的的善巧方便，本身並非目的。終極的盼望是解脫——個人存在那痛苦、疲憊的循環的最終止息，以及個體意識火焰的熄滅。這是一個以從人格的重負中最終、徹底解脫為中心的盼望。

## 4.3 Concluding Reflections: Two Answers to the Human Condition

## 4.3 總結性反思：對人類狀況的兩種回答

Christianity and Buddhism offer two powerful, sophisticated, and profoundly different answers to the fundamental questions of the human condition. They are not variations on a theme but distinct and largely irreconcilable soteriological paradigms.

基督教和佛教對人類狀況的根本問題提供了兩種強大、複雜且截然不同的答案。它們不是同一主題的變奏，而是獨特且在很大程度上不可調和的救贖論範式。

Christianity diagnoses a moral and relational problem—Sin, the rebellion of the creature against the Creator. It proposes a relational solution—reconciliation with God through the atoning work of a Divine Savior, received by grace through faith. Its ultimate promise is the perfection of the self in a state of eternal, personal communion with God.

基督教診斷出一個道德和關係上的問題——罪，即受造物對造物主的背叛。它提出一個關係性的解決方案——通過一位神聖救主的贖罪工作，藉著恩典、憑著信心與上帝和解。其終極的應許是在與上帝永恆、個人的相交狀態中，自我的完美。

Buddhism diagnoses an existential and psychological problem—Dukkha, the inherent unsatisfactoriness of conditioned existence, rooted in ignorance and craving. It proposes a methodological solution—a path of self-discipline, meditation, and wisdom taught by an Enlightened Teacher. Its ultimate promise is freedom from the self through the final extinction of personal consciousness in Nirvana.

佛教診斷出一個存在性和心理性的問題——苦，即根植於無明和渴愛的、有為法固有的不圓滿。它提出一個方法論的解決方案——一條由一位開悟導師教導的、包含自律、禪修和智慧的道路。其終極的應許是通過在涅槃中個人意識的最終寂滅，從自我中獲得自由。

To view Jesus as simply another "enlightened teacher" is to strip Him of His central claim to be a divine savior. To view the Buddha as a "savior" is to impose a theistic category onto a non-theistic system that explicitly rejects it. While both traditions share ethical values like compassion and moral discipline, these values serve radically different ultimate ends. The choice between these two great world religions is not a choice between two similar paths to salvation, but a choice between two fundamentally different understandings of reality, the nature of the self, and the meaning of ultimate good. One path leads to the restoration of a relationship with a personal God; the other leads to release from an impersonal cycle of existence. One finds liberation in the fulfillment of the self; the other finds it in the dissolution of the self.

將耶穌僅僅視為另一位「開悟的導師」，就是剝奪祂作為神聖救主的核心宣告。將佛陀視為「救主」，就是將一個有神論的範疇強加於一個明確拒絕它的非有神論體系。儘管兩種傳統都共有慈悲和道德紀律等倫理價值，但這些價值服務於截然不同的終極目標。在這兩個偉大世界宗教之間的選擇，不是在兩條相似的救贖之路間的選擇，而是在兩種對實相、自我本質和終極善的意義的根本不同理解之間的選擇。一條道路引向與有位格上帝關係的恢復；另一條則引向從非個人性存在循環中的解脫。一個在自我的實現中找到解脫；另一個則在自我的消解中找到它。

In conclusion, the comparison between Christianity and Buddhism in matters of salvation reveals two fundamentally irreconcilable worldviews. Christianity proclaims salvation as a gift of God's grace received through faith in Jesus Christ, while Buddhism teaches self-liberation through personal effort and understanding. The Christian believer rests in the finished work of Christ on the cross, while the Buddhist practitioner must continuously strive for liberation through their own efforts.

總之，在救贖問題上對基督教和佛教的比較，揭示了兩種根本上不可調和的世界觀。基督教宣稱救贖是藉著對耶穌基督的信心而領受的上帝恩典的禮物，而佛教則教導通過個人的努力和理解來自我解脫。基督徒安息在基督在十字架上已完成的工作中，而佛教修行者則必須通過自身的努力不斷追求解脫。

The Bible's testimony is clear: "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved" Acts 4:12 This exclusive claim of Christianity stands in direct opposition to Buddhism's humanistic approach to salvation, making any synthesis of these two systems impossible while maintaining the integrity of biblical truth.

聖經的見證是明確的：「除他以外，別無拯救；因為在天下人間，沒有賜下別的名，我們可以靠着得救。」（使徒行傳 4:12）基督教的這一排他性宣告與佛教的人本主義救贖方式直接對立，使得在維護聖經真理完整性的前提下，任何對這兩個體系的綜合都成為不可能。

The Bible affirm that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone - a doctrine that cannot be reconciled with Buddhism's emphasis on self-effort and human achievement. Therefore, the Christian must reject the Buddhist path as fundamentally opposed to the biblical doctrine of salvation and continue to proclaim the exclusive gospel of Jesus Christ as the only way to eternal life.

聖經申明救恩是唯獨本乎恩、唯獨藉著信、唯獨在基督裡——這一教義無法與佛教強調的自力及人的成就相調和。因此，基督徒必須拒絕佛教的道路，因其與聖經的救贖教義根本對立，並繼續宣揚耶穌基督的獨一福音，作為通往永生的唯一道路。
