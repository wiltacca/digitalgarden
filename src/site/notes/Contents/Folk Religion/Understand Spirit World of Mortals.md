# The Basic Framework of The Spiritual World In The Bible
# 圣经中属灵世界的基本架构

## The Ranks & Functions of Angels
## 天使的等级与职能

The Bible reveals an orderl~~y~~ angelic world, in which there are spiritual beings of different ranks and functions. In Ezekiel 28:14, we see: "Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire." Although this verse is ostensibly addressed to the king of Tyrus, on a deeper level it points to the exalted position of Satan before his fall, revealing the hierarchical system of the angelic world.

圣经启示了一个有序的天使世界，其中存在着不同等级和职能的属灵存在。在《以西结书》28章14节中，我们看到："你是那受膏遮掩约柜的基路伯。我将你安置在神的圣山上。你在发光如火的宝石中间往来。"这节经文虽然表面上是对推罗王说的，但更深层次是指向撒但堕落前的崇高地位，显示了天使世界的等级制度。

Isaiah 6:2 describes the seraphims: "Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly." The seraphims worship around God's throne, representing the highest rank of angels. And Daniel 10:13 mentions a warring angel: "But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia." Michael is called a "chief prince," indicating a military rank within the angelic host.

《以赛亚书》6章2节描述了撒拉弗："其上有撒拉弗侍立。各有六个翅膀。用两个翅膀遮脸，两个翅膀遮脚，两个翅膀飞翔。"撒拉弗在上帝宝座周围敬拜，代表着最高等级的天使。而《但以理书》10章13节提到了争战的天使："但波斯国的魔君，拦阻我二十一日。忽然有大君中的一位米迦勒来帮助我。"米迦勒被称为"大君"，显示了天使军队中的军事等级。

Colossians 1:16 describes the levels of the spiritual world more comprehensively: "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him." Here, "principalities" and "powers" refer to both the good angels in heaven and the fallen evil angels, demonstrating the complex power structure of the spiritual world.

《歌罗西书》1章16节更全面地描述了属灵世界的层次："因为万有都是靠他造的，无论是天上的，地上的，能看见的，不能看见的，或是有位的，主治的，执政的，掌权的，一概都是藉着他造的，又是为他造的。"这里的"执政的，掌权的"既指天上的良善天使，也包括堕落的恶天使，展现了属灵世界复杂的权力结构。

## The Organization of Satan and the Demonic Host
## 撒但与恶魔军团的组织

The Bible clearly reveals that Satan does not fight alone but commands an organized legion of demons. Revelation 12:7-9 records the war in heaven: "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."

圣经清楚地启示撒但不是独自作战，而是统领着一个有组织的恶魔军团。《启示录》12章7-9节记录了天上的争战："在天上就有了争战。米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战。龙也同他的使者去争战。并没有得胜，天上再没有他们的地方。大龙就是那古蛇，名叫魔鬼，又叫撒但，是迷惑普天下的。他被摔在地上，他的使者也一同被摔下去。"

This passage shows that Satan has "his angels," that is, an army of fallen angels. Ephesians 6:12 further describes the hierarchy of this dark force: "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." The mention here of "principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world" indicates that the demonic world also has its organizational structure and spheres of control.

这段经文显示撒但拥有"他的使者"，即堕落天使的军队。《以弗所书》6章12节进一步描述了这个黑暗势力的等级："因我们并不是与属血气的争战，乃是与那些执政的，掌权的，管辖这幽暗世界的，以及天空属灵气的恶魔争战。"这里提到的"执政的，掌权的，管辖这幽暗世界的"表明恶魔世界也有其组织结构和管辖范围。

Matthew 25:41 reveals the purpose for which hell was created: "Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:" This verse not only confirms that Satan has his angels (evil angels) but also shows that their final judgment is already determined.

《马太福音》25章41节启示了地狱的创造目的："王又要向那左边的说，你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去。"这节经文不仅确认了撒但有其使者（恶天使），也表明他们最终的审判已经注定。

# The Destination of The Soul After Death & The Intermediate State
# 人死后灵魂的归宿与中间状态

## The Destination of the Soul of the Righteous
## 义人灵魂的归宿

The Bible teaches that the destination of a person's soul after death depends on their relationship with God during their life. Luke 16:22-23, through the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, reveals the immediate state after death: "And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."

圣经教导人死后灵魂的去向取决于其在世时与上帝的关系。《路加福音》16章22-23节通过财主和拉撒路的比喻启示了死后的immediate状态："后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。财主也死了，并且埋葬了。他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远地望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里。"

"Abraham's bosom" represents the resting place for the souls of the righteous after death, a place of comfort and peace. In 2 Corinthians 5:8, Paul says: "We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord." This indicates that upon death, a believer's soul is immediately with Christ in heaven.

"亚伯拉罕的怀里"代表义人死后灵魂的安息之所，这是一个舒适和平安的地方。《哥林多后书》5章8节保罗说："我们坦然无惧，是更愿意离开身体与主同住。"这表明信徒死后灵魂立即与基督同在天上。

In Philippians 1:23, Paul expresses the same hope: "For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:" These verses confirm that upon death, a believer's soul immediately enters a glorious state with Christ, awaiting the resurrection of the body.

《腓立比书》1章23节保罗表达了同样的盼望："我正在两难之间，情愿离世与基督同在。因为这是好得无比的。"这些经文确认了信徒死后灵魂立即进入与基督同在的荣耀状态，等待身体复活。

## The State of Suffering For The Souls of The Wicked
## 恶人灵魂的痛苦状态

For those who reject salvation, the Bible reveals a completely different outcome. In the parable of Lazarus and the rich man, the rich man is in torment in hell, indicating that the wicked enter a state of suffering immediately after death. Luke 16:24 records the rich man's plea: "And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."

对于拒绝救恩的人，圣经启示了截然不同的结局。在拉撒路和财主的比喻中，财主在阴间受痛苦，这表明恶人死后立即进入痛苦的状态。《路加福音》16章24节记录财主的呼求："就喊着说，我祖亚伯拉罕哪，可怜我吧，打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头。因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。"

1 Peter 3:19 mentions that Christ "By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;", where "prison" refers to a place where souls are detained. Jude 1:6 also mentions, "And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."

《彼得前书》3章19节提到基督"藉这灵，他也曾去传道给那些在监狱里的灵听"，这里的"监狱"指的是灵魂被拘留的地方。《犹大书》6节也提到"又有不守本位，离开自己住处的天使，主用锁链把他们永远拘留在黑暗里，等候大日的审判。"

These scriptures indicate the existence of an intermediate state, where the souls of the wicked and fallen angels await the final judgment.

这些经文显示存在着一个中间状态，在那里恶人的灵魂和堕落天使等候最后审判的到来。

# The Nature & Activities of Various Spiritual Beings
# 各类属灵存在的本质与活动

## The Nature and Activities of Various Spiritual Beings
## 守护天使的事工

The Bible reveals that angels are sent by God to minister to and protect God's people. Hebrews 1:14 clearly states: "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" This verse indicates that the primary duty of angels is to serve God and help believers.

圣经启示天使受上帝差遣来服事和保护上帝的子民。《希伯来书》1章14节明确说明："天使岂不都是服役的灵，奉差遣为那将要承受救恩的人效力吗？"这节经文表明天使的主要职责是服事上帝和帮助信徒。

Psalm 34:7 declares: "The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them." Psalm 91:11-12 describes more specifically: "For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone."

《诗篇》34篇7节宣告："耶和华的使者，在敬畏他的人四围安营搭救他们。"《诗篇》91篇11-12节更具体地描述："因他要为你吩咐他的使者，在你行的一切道路上保护你。他们要用手托着你，免得你的脚碰在石头上。"

In Matthew 18:10, the Lord Jesus says: "Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven." This suggests that at least children have guardian angels who have direct access to the Father in heaven.

《马太福音》18章10节主耶稣说："你们要小心，不可轻看这小子里的一个。我告诉你们，他们的使者在天上，常见我天父的面。"这表明至少儿童有守护天使，这些天使可以直接朝见天父。

## The Deception and Attacks of Demons
## 恶魔的迷惑与攻击

The Bible clearly warns believers to be vigilant against the various tactics of the devil. In 2 Corinthians 11:14, Paul warns: "And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light." This shows that Satan will disguise himself to deceive people.

圣经清楚地警告信徒要警惕恶魔的各种攻击手段。《哥林多后书》11章14节保罗警告："这也不足为怪。因为连撒但也装作光明的天使。"这显示撒但会伪装自己来迷惑人。

1 Timothy 4:1 prophesies the deception of the last days: "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;" The mention of "seducing spirits" and "doctrines of devils" here shows that demons will use false doctrines to deceive people.

《提摩太前书》4章1节预言末世的迷惑："圣灵明说，在后来的时候，必有人离弃真道，听从那引诱人的邪灵，和鬼魔的道理。"这里提到"引诱人的邪灵"和"鬼魔的道理"，显示恶魔会通过假教义来迷惑人。

Revelation 16:14 describes the deception of the last days: "For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty." This indicates that demons can perform miracles to deceive the world, and even kings will be deceived.

《启示录》16章14节描述末世的迷惑："他们本是鬼魔的灵，施行奇事，出去到普天下众王那里，叫他们在神全能者的大日聚集争战。"这表明恶魔能够行奇事来迷惑世人，甚至连君王也会被欺骗。

## The Phenomenon of Demonic Possession
## 被鬼附身的现象

The New Testament records many cases of demon possession, showing that demons can control and torment human beings. Mark 5:2-5 describes the man possessed by a legion of demons: "And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones."

新约圣经记录了许多被鬼附身的案例，显示恶魔可以控制和折磨人类。《马可福音》5章2-5节描述了被群鬼附身的人："耶稣一下船，就有一个被污鬼附着的人，从坟茔里出来迎着他。那人常住在坟茔里，没有人能捆住他，就是用铁链也不能。因为人屡次用脚镣和铁链捆锁他，铁链竟被他挣断了，脚镣也被他弄碎了。总没有人能制伏他。他昼夜常在坟茔里和山中喊叫，又用石头砍自己。"

This case shows that a demon-possessed person exhibits supernatural strength, self-harming behavior, and lives in unclean places. Luke 8:27 adds that this man "ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs," showing that demon possession can cause a person to lose normal reason and social function.

这个案例显示被鬼附身的人会表现出超自然的力量、自残行为、住在不洁净的地方等特征。《路加福音》8章27节补充说这人"穿不着衣服，不住房子，只住在坟茔里"，显示被鬼附身会导致人失去正常的理智和社会功能。

Matthew 17:15-18 records a boy whose epilepsy was caused by a demon: "Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour."

《马太福音》17章15-18节记录了一个被鬼附身导致癫痫的少年人："主啊，怜悯我的儿子。他害癫痫的病很苦，屡次跌在火里，屡次跌在水里。我带他到你门徒那里，他们却不能医治他。耶稣说，嗳，这又不信又悖谬的世代啊，我在你们这里要到几时呢。我忍耐你们要到几时呢。把他带到我这里来吧。耶稣斥责那鬼，鬼就出来。从此孩子就痊愈了。"

# The Christian's Spiritual Warfare & The Way To Victory
## 基督徒的属灵争战与得胜之道

## The Reality of Spiritual Warfare

## 属灵争战的现实性

Ephesians 6:11-12 clearly teaches that Christians must face spiritual warfare: "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."

《以弗所书》6章11-12节清楚地教导基督徒必须面对属灵争战："要穿戴神所赐的全副军装，就能抵挡魔鬼的诡计。因我们并不是与属血气的争战，乃是与那些执政的，掌权的，管辖这幽暗世界的，以及天空属灵气的恶魔争战。"

This passage points out that the true enemy of Christians is not human, but spiritual evil forces. These evil forces are organized, have ranks, and are actively fighting against the kingdom of God. 1 Peter 5:8 warns: "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"

这段经文指出基督徒的真正敌人不是人，而是属灵的恶势力。这些恶势力有组织、有等级，并且正在积极地与上帝的国度争战。《彼得前书》5章8节警告："务要谨守，儆醒。因为你们的仇敌魔鬼，如同吼叫的狮子，遍地游行，寻找可吞吃的人。"

James 4:7 gives the secret to victory: "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." This shows that it is possible to resist Satan, but the prerequisite is to first submit to God.

《雅各书》4章7节给出了得胜的秘诀："故此你们要顺服神。务要抵挡魔鬼，魔鬼就必离开你们逃跑了。"这显示抵挡撒但是可能的，但前提是要先顺服上帝。

## The Importance of the Spiritual Armor
## 属灵军装的重要性

Ephesians 6:13-17 describes in detail the spiritual armor that Christians should wear: "Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"

《以弗所书》6章13-17节详细描述了基督徒应当穿戴的属灵军装："所以要拿起神所赐的全副军装，好在磨难的日子，抵挡仇敌，并且成就了一切，还能站立得住。所以要站稳了，用真理当作带子束腰，用公义当作护心镜遮胸。又用平安的福音，当作预备走路的鞋穿在脚上。此外又拿着信德当作藤牌，可以灭尽那恶者一切的火箭。并戴上救恩的头盔，拿着圣灵的宝剑，就是神的道。"

Each piece of armor has its specific spiritual meaning: the belt of truth represents honesty and integrity, the breastplate of righteousness protects the heart from the invasion of sin, the shoes of the gospel of peace enable us to stand firm and spread the gospel, the shield of faith can withstand Satan's attacks, the helmet of salvation protects our minds, and the sword of the Spirit (the Word of God) is our only offensive weapon.

每一件军装都有其特定的属灵意义：真理的带子代表诚实和正直，公义的护心镜保护心灵不受罪恶侵犯，平安福音的鞋子使我们能够站稳脚跟传扬福音，信心的盾牌能够抵挡撒但的攻击，救恩的头盔保护我们的思想，圣灵的宝剑（上帝的话语）是我们唯一的攻击武器。

## The Power of Prayer and Fasting
## 祷告与禁食的能力

The Lord Jesus taught his disciples in Matthew 17:21: "Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting." This shows that certain levels of spiritual warfare require prayer and fasting. Prayer is the main way for Christians to communicate with God and draw upon heavenly power.

主耶稣在《马太福音》17章21节教导门徒："至于这一类的鬼，若不祷告禁食，他就不出来。"这显示某些程度的属灵争战需要通过祷告和禁食来进行。祷告是基督徒与上帝沟通并支取属天能力的主要途径。

Ephesians 6:18 follows the description of the armor by saying: "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;" This indicates that prayer itself is part of spiritual warfare.

《以弗所书》6章18节紧随军装的描述后说："靠着圣灵，随时多方祷告祈求，并要在此儆醒不倦，为众圣徒祈求。"这表明祷告本身就是属灵争战的一部分。

Daniel chapter 10 records how Daniel's 21 days of prayer influenced the spiritual battle in the heavens, showing that persistent prayer has a real impact in the spiritual realm.

《但以理书》10章记录了但以理的21天祷告如何影响了天上的属灵争战，显示持续的祷告在属灵世界中有着真实的影响力。

## A Biblical Response to Pagan Concepts of Gods and Spirits
## 对异教鬼神观念的圣经回应

## The Spiritual Truth of Idolatry
## 偶像崇拜的属灵真相

The Bible explicitly links pagan gods with demons. In 1 Corinthians 10:20, Paul states clearly: "But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils." This verse reveals the true nature of pagan sacrifices—they are communion with demons.

圣经明确地将异教的神明与恶魔联系起来。《哥林多前书》10章20节保罗明确说："我乃是说，外邦人所献的祭，是祭鬼，不是祭神。我不愿意你们与鬼相交。"这节经文揭示了异教祭祀的真实本质——是在与恶魔相交。

Deuteronomy 32:17 also confirms this: "They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not." The word for "devils" here in Hebrew is "shedim," which refers to demons.

《申命记》32章17节也证实了这一点："所祭祀的鬼魔，并非真神，乃是素不认识的神，是近来新兴的，是你们列祖所不畏惧的。"这里的"鬼魔"在希伯来文中是"shedim"，指的是恶魔。

Psalm 106:37-38 condemns the idolatry of the Israelites: "Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood." These verses show that behind idols, demonic forces are at work.

《诗篇》106篇37-38节谴责以色列人的偶像崇拜："把自己的儿女祭祀鬼魔。流无辜人的血，就是自己儿女的血，把他们祭祀迦南的偶像。那地就被血污秽了。"这些经文显示偶像背后都有恶魔的势力在运作。

## The Dangers of Divination and Sorcery
## 占卜与邪术的危险

The Bible strictly forbids all forms of divination and sorcery. Deuteronomy 18:10-12 lists the forbidden practices: "There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD:"

圣经严厉禁止各种形式的占卜和邪术。《申命记》18章10-12节列举了被禁止的行为："你们中间不可有人使儿女经火，也不可有占卜的，观兆的，用法术的，行邪术的，用迷术的，交鬼的，行巫术的，过阴的。凡行这些事的，都为耶和华所憎恶。"

1 Samuel 28 records the incident of King Saul consulting a woman with a familiar spirit, which resulted in disastrous consequences. Acts 19:19 records the believers in Ephesus burning their sorcery books after repenting: "Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."

《撒母耳记上》28章记录了扫罗王找交鬼的妇人的事件，结果带来了灾难性的后果。《使徒行传》19章19节记录了以弗所的信徒悔改后烧毁邪术书籍："平素行邪术的，也有许多人把书拿来，堆积在众人面前焚烧。他们算计书的价值，便知道共合五万块钱。"

These scriptures show that God strictly forbids any form of communion with evil spirits, because such acts bring people under the power of Satan.

这些经文表明上帝严厉禁止任何形式的与邪灵相交的行为，因为这些行为会使人陷入撒但的权势之下。

# The Intensification of Spiritual Warfare In The Last Days
# 末世属灵争战的加剧

## The Increase of Deception in the Last Days
## 末世迷惑的增加

The Lord Jesus prophesied the deception of the last days in Matthew 24:24: "For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." This indicates that in the last days, Satan's power to deceive will reach an unprecedented level.

主耶稣在《马太福音》24章24节预言末世的迷惑："因为假基督，假先知，将要起来，显大神迹，大奇事。倘若能行，连选民也就迷惑了。"这显示在末世，撒但的迷惑能力将达到前所未有的程度。

2 Thessalonians 2:9-11 further describes: "Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"

《帖撒罗尼迦后书》2章9-11节进一步描述："这不法的人来，是照撒但的运动，行各样的异能神迹，和一切虚假的奇事。并且在那沉沦的人身上，行各样出于不义的诡诈。因他们不领受爱真理的心，使他们得救。故此，神就给他们一个生发错误的心，叫他们信从虚谎。"

Revelation 13:13-14 describes the power of the Antichrist: "And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast;"

《启示录》13章13-14节描述敌基督的能力："又行大奇事，甚至在人面前，叫火从天降在地上。他因赐给他权柄在兽面前能行奇事，就迷惑住在地上的人。"

## The Final War Between Angels and Demons
## 天使与恶魔的最终战争

Revelation 12:7-9 describes the war in heaven, the final confrontation between Michael and Satan. Revelation 20:1-3 prophesies that Satan will be bound for a thousand years: "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season."

《启示录》12章7-9节描述了天上的战争，米迦勒与撒但的最终对决。《启示录》20章1-3节预言撒但将被捆绑一千年："我又看见一个天使从天降下，手里拿着无底坑的钥匙，和一条大链子。他捉住那龙，就是古蛇，又叫魔鬼，也叫撒但，把他捆绑一千年。扔在无底坑里，将无底坑关闭，用印封上，使他不得再迷惑列国，等到那一千年完了。以后必须暂时释放他。"

Finally, Revelation 20:10 prophesies Satan's ultimate end: "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

最终，《启示录》20章10节预言撒但的最终结局："那迷惑他们的魔鬼，被扔在硫磺的火湖里，就是兽和假先知所在的地方。他们必昼夜受痛苦，直到永永远远。"

# Conclusion
# 结论

Through an in-depth study of the Bible, we clearly recognize the reality and complexity of the spiritual world. God created an orderly angelic world to serve Him and His people, but the fall of Satan brought about the reality of spiritual warfare. Christians live in this world where the visible and invisible intersect, and must recognize that we face real spiritual enemies, but at the same time be assured that we are already victorious in Christ.

通过对圣经的深入研究，我们清楚地认识到属灵世界的真实性和复杂性。上帝创造了有序的天使世界来服事祂和祂的百姓，但撒但的堕落带来了属灵争战的现实。基督徒生活在这个可见与不可见交错的世界中，必须认识到我们面对的是真实的属灵敌人，但同时也要确信我们在基督里已经得胜。

Although pagan concepts of gods and spirits acknowledge the existence of the spiritual world, they lead people down the dangerous path of communion with demons. Only through the revelation of the Bible can we correctly understand the truth of the spiritual world and know how to be victorious in spiritual warfare. Christians should put on the full armor of God, rely on prayer and the Word of God, and stand firm in the intensifying spiritual warfare of these last days, until the Lord Jesus returns to establish His kingdom, when all evil forces will be utterly defeated, and God's people will be with Christ forever in the new heaven and new earth.

异教的鬼神观念虽然承认了属灵世界的存在，但将人引向与恶魔相交的危险道路。只有通过圣经的启示，我们才能正确理解属灵世界的真相，并且知道如何在属灵争战中得胜。基督徒当穿戴全副军装，依靠祷告和上帝的话语，在这末世加剧的属灵争战中站立得稳，直到主耶稣再来建立祂的国度，那时所有的恶势力都将被彻底败坏，上帝的子民将在新天新地中与基督永远同在。

Such understanding not only helps us to comprehend the nature of the spiritual phenomena around us, but more importantly, it equips us to be victorious in spiritual warfare through the Lord, to live lives that glorify God and benefit others, until the day we see the Lord face to face.

这样的认识不仅帮助我们理解周围属灵现象的本质，更重要的是装备我们在属灵争战中靠主得胜，活出荣神益人的生活，直到见主面的日子。
