# Mahayana Buddhism & Theravada Buddhism 

# 大乘佛教与原始佛教

Mahayana Buddhism (Mahāyāna) and Theravada Buddhism (Theravāda or Early Buddhism) are the two major branches of Buddhism, and they have significant differences in aspects such as doctrines, practices, and goals.

大乘佛教（Mahāyāna）与原始佛教（Theravāda 或早期佛教）是佛教的两大主要分支，它们在教义、修行方式以及目标等方面有显著的差异。

# Theravāda Buddhism 

# 原始佛教

## Origin & Development 

## 起源与发展 

Theravada Buddhism, also known as the School of the Elders, is the earliest form of Buddhism, originating from the direct teachings of Gautama Buddha. It is mainly prevalent in South and Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia.

原始佛教，也被称为上座部佛教（Theravāda），是佛教最早的形式，源自释迦牟尼佛（Gautama Buddha）的直接教导。它主要流行于南亚和东南亚的国家，如斯里兰卡、泰国、缅甸、老挝和柬埔寨。

## Doctrine 

## 教义

Theravada Buddhism emphasizes individual liberation, striving to become an Arahant, that is, to attain Nirvana and escape the cycle of birth and death (samsara) through rigorous practice. Practitioners are guided by the Noble Eightfold Path, uphold the monastic discipline (Vinaya), and focus on fundamental doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths and the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.

原始佛教强调个人解脱，追求成为阿罗汉（Arahant），即通过严格修行达到涅槃，解脱生死轮回。修行者以八正道为指导，修持戒律（Vinaya），并注重四圣谛、十二因缘等基本教义。

## Scriptures 

## 经典

The main scriptures are the Pāli Canon (Tipitaka), which includes the Vinaya Pitaka (Basket of Discipline), the Sutta Pitaka (Basket of Discourses), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (Basket of Higher Doctrine).

经典主要为《巴利三藏》（Tipitaka），包括律藏（Vinaya Pitaka）、经藏（Sutta Pitaka）和论藏（Abhidhamma Pitaka）。

## Goal of Practice 

## 修行目标 

The main goal is to achieve enlightenment through one's own efforts, become an Arahant, and end the personal cycle of birth and death.

主要目标是通过自己的努力达到觉悟，成为阿罗汉，终结个人的生死轮回。

# Mahāyāna Buddhism 

# 大乘佛教

## Origin & Development 

## 起源与发展 

Mahayana Buddhism developed on the foundation of early Buddhism, forming around the 1st century BCE to the 1st century CE, and later spread widely to East Asia, such as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.

大乘佛教在原始佛教的基础上发展起来，大约在公元前1世纪至公元1世纪之间形成，后来广泛传播到东亚，如中国、日本、韩国和越南。

## Doctrine 

## 教义

The core of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva path, which advocates that all sentient beings have Buddha-nature and everyone can become a Buddha. Mahayana Buddhism promotes compassion, and practitioners not only seek personal liberation but also help other sentient beings to achieve enlightenment. Typical Mahayana doctrines include emptiness (śūnyatā), the Middle Way (Madhyamaka), and Consciousness-Only (Yogācāra).

大乘佛教的核心是菩萨道，倡导众生皆有佛性，人人可以成佛。大乘佛教提倡慈悲心，修行者不仅要追求个人解脱，还要帮助其他众生达到觉悟。典型的大乘教义包括空性、中观、唯识等。

## Scriptures 

## 经典

Mahayana Buddhist scriptures include the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras, the Avataṃsaka Sūtra, the Lotus Sūtra, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, etc. Their content is extensive, emphasizing the compassion and wisdom of the Bodhisattva.

大乘佛教经典包括《般若经》、《华严经》、《法华经》、《涅槃经》等，内容广泛，强调菩萨的慈悲与智慧。

## Goal of Practice 

## 修行目标 

To aspire to become a Bodhisattva, not only liberating oneself but also delivering countless sentient beings, and ultimately attaining Buddhahood.

追求成为菩萨（Bodhisattva），不仅自我解脱，还要度化无量众生，最终成就佛果。

---

# Main Differences 

# 主要区别

The goal of Theravada Buddhism is individual liberation, becoming an Arahant, whereas the goal of Mahayana Buddhism is to become a Buddha and help all sentient beings achieve liberation.

修行目标 (Goal of Practice): 原始佛教的目标是个人解脱，成为阿罗汉，而大乘佛教的目标是成佛，并帮助一切众生解脱。

Theravada doctrine is relatively conservative, emphasizing strict adherence to precepts and individual practice, while Mahayana doctrine is broader and more flexible, focusing on the Bodhisattva path and the liberation of all beings.

教义范围 (Scope of Doctrine): 原始佛教教义相对保守，强调严格遵守戒律和个人修行，而大乘佛教教义更为广泛和灵活，注重菩萨道和众生的解脱。

Theravada Buddhism relies mainly on the Pāli Canon, whereas the Mahayana canon is more diverse, containing many sutras and treatises that developed later.

经典体系 (Scriptural Canon): 原始佛教主要依赖巴利文经典，而大乘佛教经典则更加多样化，包含许多后期发展起来的经论。

Mahayana Buddhism has a more complex and expansive cosmology, such as infinite worlds and countless Buddha-lands, while the cosmology of Theravada Buddhism is relatively simple.

宇宙观 (Cosmology): 大乘佛教具有更为复杂和广泛的宇宙观，如无量世界、无数佛土等，而原始佛教的宇宙观相对简单。

In summary, Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism represent two important stages and directions in the development of Buddhism. The former focuses on the ideal of compassion and the universal salvation of all beings, while the latter emphasizes individual practice and liberation. The two have significant differences in Buddhist doctrine, methods of practice, and ultimate goals, but both originate from the teachings of Gautama Buddha and have made important contributions to the development and spread of Buddhism.

总结而言，大乘佛教和原始佛教代表了佛教发展的两个重要阶段和方向。前者注重慈悲和普度众生的理念，后者则强调个人修行和解脱。两者在佛教的教义、修行方式和最终目标上存在显著的差异，但都源于释迦牟尼佛的教导，并为佛教的发展和传播做出了重要贡献。

# How To Evangelize To Theravāda Buddhists? 

# 如何传福音给原始佛教徒?

Sharing the Christian gospel with Theravāda Buddhists is a task that requires great sensitivity, understanding, and wisdom. Because Theravāda Buddhists have a deep understanding and strong faith in their beliefs, it is necessary to be particularly careful to respect their cultural and religious background when evangelizing. Here are a few key steps and strategies:

将基督教福音传递给原始佛教徒（Theravāda 佛教徒）是一项需要极大敏感性、理解力和智慧的任务。因为原始佛教徒对其信仰有着深刻的理解和强烈的信仰，在传福音时，需要特别注意尊重他们的文化和宗教背景。以下是几个关键步骤和策略：

## 1.  Understand Theravāda Buddhist Doctrines 

## 1. 了解原始佛教教义

The first step in evangelism is to deeply understand the basic doctrines and practices of Theravāda Buddhism. Theravāda Buddhists place great importance on doctrines such as the "Four Noble Truths" and the "Noble Eightfold Path," which form their worldview. You need to understand how they view concepts like suffering, rebirth, karma, and liberation, so that you can communicate with them effectively and explain Christian doctrines within the context of their beliefs.

传福音的第一步是深入了解原始佛教的基本教义和实践。原始佛教徒非常重视“四圣谛”和“八正道”等教义，这些教义构成了他们的世界观。你需要理解他们如何看待痛苦、轮回、业力和解脱等概念，这样你才能有效地与他们进行沟通，并能够在他们的信仰背景下解释基督教教义。

## 2. Build Relationships 

## 2. 建立关系

In Buddhist culture, relationships and trust are crucial. To evangelize, you must first spend time building a sincere relationship with Theravāda Buddhists. By showing care, help, and demonstrating Christian love and concern, you can let them feel the practical impact and power of the Christian faith.

在佛教文化中，关系和信任是至关重要的。要传福音，首先必须花时间与原始佛教徒建立真诚的关系。通过关心、帮助、以及展示基督徒的爱与关怀，可以让他们感受到基督教信仰的实际影响和力量。

## 3. Emphasize Common Ground 

## 3. 强调共通点

Rather than directly opposing Buddhist doctrines, it is better to find and emphasize the common ground between Christianity and Theravāda Buddhism. For example:

与其直接对立佛教教义，不如寻找和强调基督教与原始佛教之间的共通点。例如：

Buddhists value a moral life, and Christianity also emphasizes love, righteousness, and honesty. You can start here to discuss the meaning of jointly pursuing good deeds.

道德生活 (Moral Life): 佛教徒重视道德生活，而基督教也强调仁爱、正义和诚实。可以从这里入手，探讨共同追求善行的意义。

Buddhism focuses on the root of suffering and liberation from it, while Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ is the ultimate answer to human sin and suffering. You can guide them to think about how Jesus took upon Himself the sins of all mankind to provide ultimate deliverance.

苦难的解决 (The Solution to Suffering): 佛教关注痛苦的根源与解脱，而基督教教导耶稣基督是解决人类罪恶和痛苦的最终答案。可以引导他们思考耶稣如何为全人类承担罪孽，提供最终的解脱。

## 4.  Introduce Jesus Christ 

## 4. 介绍耶稣基督

When introducing Jesus, you can describe Him as a Savior full of love and compassion, who provided not only individual redemption but also salvation for all humanity. You can quote Matthew 11:28-30: Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. This verse shows Jesus' care and compassion for suffering humanity.

在介绍耶稣时，可以把他描述为一位充满慈爱和同情心的救主，祂不只是为个人提供了救赎，还为全人类提供了救恩。可以引用《马太福音》11:28-30：“凡劳苦担重担的人，可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。”这节经文显示了耶稣对痛苦人类的关怀和怜悯。

## 5. Share Personal Testimony 

## 5. 分享个人见证

Personal testimony is very effective in evangelism. You can share how you have experienced Christ's love and grace, and how you have found peace and joy in life through faith. Such personal stories can resonate on an emotional level and help them see the practical meaning of faith.

个人见证在传福音中非常有效。你可以分享自己如何经历基督的爱与恩典，如何通过信仰在生活中找到平安与喜乐。这种个人的故事可以在情感层面引起共鸣，帮助他们看到信仰的实际意义。

## 6. Invite Them to Discuss the Bible 

## 6. 邀请探讨圣经

Theravāda Buddhists value wisdom and understanding, so you can invite them to discuss the Bible together, especially the words and deeds of Jesus in the New Testament. Through joint study, you can gradually guide them to understand the core doctrines of Christianity, such as salvation, resurrection, and eternal life.

原始佛教徒重视智慧和理解，因此可以邀请他们一起探讨《圣经》，特别是《新约》中的耶稣言行。通过共同学习，你可以逐渐引导他们认识基督教的核心教义，如救恩、复活和永生。

## 7.  Prayer & Patience 

## 7. 祷告与耐心

Evangelism requires patience and continuous prayer. Theravāda Buddhists are very devoted to their faith, so they may need time to understand and accept the Christian faith. Pray for them, asking God to move their hearts and lead them to know Jesus Christ.

传福音需要耐心和持续的祷告。原始佛教徒对他们的信仰非常忠诚，因此他们可能需要时间来理解和接受基督教信仰。为他们祷告，求神感动他们的心，带领他们认识耶稣基督。

## 8.  Cultural Sensitivity 

## 8. 文化敏感性

Throughout the process of evangelism, always maintain cultural sensitivity and respect. Their religious customs, rituals, and way of life are part of their culture, so when conveying the message, you need to avoid causing offense or being coercive, and instead communicate through understanding and respect.

在传福音过程中，始终保持文化敏感性和尊重。他们的宗教习惯、仪式、以及生活方式是他们文化的一部分，因此在传递信息时需要避免冒犯或强迫，而是通过理解和尊重来沟通。

# Conclusion 

# 结论

Evangelizing to Theravāda Buddhists requires building relationships, respecting their culture, emphasizing common ground, introducing Christ, sharing testimonies, discussing the Bible together, and having prayer and patience. In this way, you can gently guide them to know Jesus Christ and experience the power and meaning of faith in their lives.

向原始佛教徒传福音需要通过建立关系、尊重文化、强调共通点、介绍基督、分享见证、共同探讨圣经以及祷告和耐心来进行。通过这种方式，你可以温和地引导他们认识耶稣基督，并在他们的生活中体验到信仰的力量和意义。

# How To Evangelize To Mahāyāna Buddhists? 

# 如何传福音给大乘佛教徒?

Sharing the gospel with Mahāyāna Buddhists is a challenging yet potential-filled task. The belief system of Mahāyāna Buddhists is vast and complex, so when evangelizing, one must keenly understand their doctrines and communicate with respect and wisdom. Here are some strategies and steps to help you communicate more effectively with Mahāyāna Buddhists when evangelizing.

将福音传给大乘佛教徒（Mahāyāna 佛教徒）是一项具有挑战性但也充满潜力的任务。大乘佛教徒的信仰体系庞大而复杂，因此在传福音时，需要敏锐地理解他们的教义，并以尊重和智慧的方式进行沟通。以下是一些策略和步骤，帮助你在传福音时更加有效地与大乘佛教徒交流。

## 1. Understand Mahāyāna Buddhist Doctrines &  Cultural Background 

## 1. 了解大乘佛教的教义和文化背景

The belief system of Mahāyāna Buddhists includes core doctrines such as the Bodhisattva path, Buddha-nature, emptiness, and the universal salvation of all beings. To evangelize effectively, you need to have a deep understanding of these concepts and how they influence the faith and life of Buddhists. For example, the Bodhisattva path emphasizes not only seeking personal liberation but also helping all sentient beings; therefore, Mahāyāna Buddhists place great importance on compassion and the spirit of helping others.

大乘佛教徒的信仰体系包括了菩萨道、佛性、空性和众生普度等核心教义。要有效地传福音，你需要深入了解这些概念，以及他们如何影响佛教徒的信仰和生活。例如，菩萨道强调不只追求个人解脱，还要帮助所有众生，因此，大乘佛教徒非常注重慈悲心和助人精神。

## 2. Build Deep Relationships 

## 2. 建立深厚的关系

Before evangelizing, it is crucial to establish a sincere and trusting relationship with Mahāyāna Buddhists. Demonstrating Christian love, compassion, and selfless help can make them feel the attractiveness of the Christian faith. Building a relationship takes time and patience, but it is a solid foundation for evangelism.

在传福音之前，与大乘佛教徒建立真诚和信任的关系是至关重要的。展示基督徒的爱心、同情心和无私帮助，能够让他们感受到基督信仰的吸引力。关系的建立需要时间和耐心，但这是传福音的坚实基础。

## 3. Find Common Ground 

## 3. 寻找共通点

Rather than directly opposing Buddhist doctrines, it is better to start from common ground to build a bridge for dialogue. For example:

与其直接对立佛教教义，不如从共通点入手，建立对话的桥梁。例如：

Mahāyāna Buddhists highly value compassion, and Christianity also teaches "love your neighbor as yourself" (Mark 12:31, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.). You can start with Jesus Christ's love and sacrifice for humanity to discuss what true compassion is.

慈悲心与爱 (Compassion and Love): 大乘佛教徒高度重视慈悲心，基督教也教导爱人如己（马可福音 12:31）。可以从耶稣基督对人类的爱和牺牲入手，探讨什么是真正的慈悲。

The ideal of the Bodhisattva path is to sacrifice oneself for the liberation of others. You can compare the self-sacrifice of Jesus and His work of saving the world with this, explaining how Jesus paid the price for the sins of all mankind to achieve ultimate redemption.

菩萨道与基督的牺牲 (The Bodhisattva Path and Christ's Sacrifice): 菩萨道的理想是为了他人的解脱而牺牲自己。你可以将耶稣的自我牺牲和拯救世人的事迹与之对比，解释耶稣如何为全人类的罪付出代价，以实现最终的救赎。

## 4.  Introduce The Uniqueness of Jesus Christ 

## 4. 介绍耶稣基督的独特性

Mahāyāna Buddhists believe that Buddha-nature is universally present in all sentient beings and that everyone can become a Buddha. However, Christian doctrine points out that only Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God, the one and only Savior. When introducing Jesus, you can emphasize His uniqueness, that He is the only Savior who can truly save humanity from sin and death.

大乘佛教徒相信佛性普遍存在于所有众生之中，人人都可以成佛。然而，基督教教义指出，唯有耶稣基督是神的独生子，是唯一的救主。在介绍耶稣时，可以强调祂的独特性，祂是唯一能够真正拯救人类脱离罪恶和死亡的救主。

你可以引用《约翰福音》14:6：“耶稣说：‘我就是道路、真理、生命；若不借着我，没有人能到父那里去。’”

You can quote John 14:6: ’Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

您可以引用: “耶穌說：‘我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉著我，沒有人能到父那裡去。"

## 5. Share Personal Testimony 

## 5. 分享个人见证

Personal testimony has a great influence in evangelism. By sharing your personal experiences and life changes in the Christian faith, you can help Mahāyāna Buddhists see the practical impact of Christianity. Authentic experiences often resonate with people on an emotional and spiritual level.

个人见证在传福音中有很大的影响力。通过分享你在基督教信仰中的个人经历和生命改变，可以帮助大乘佛教徒看到基督信仰的实际影响。真实的经历往往能够在情感和精神层面上与人产生共鸣。

## 6. Encourage Reading The Bible 

## 6. 鼓励阅读《圣经》

Mahāyāna Buddhists place great importance on wisdom and the understanding of doctrines, so you can invite them to discuss the Bible together. In particular, the life, teachings, and deeds of Jesus in the New Testament can help them gradually understand the core content of the Christian faith.

大乘佛教徒对智慧和教义的理解非常重视，因此可以邀请他们一起探讨《圣经》。特别是《新约》中耶稣的生平、教导和事迹，能够帮助他们逐步了解基督教信仰的核心内容。

## 7.  Gently &  Firmly Explain The Truth of Salvation 

## 7. 温和而坚定地讲解救恩的真理

Mahāyāna Buddhists may find the Christian concepts of sin and redemption unfamiliar or difficult to accept. It is necessary to patiently explain that all humanity has fallen due to sin and cannot achieve liberation through their own efforts. Only through the grace of Jesus Christ can true redemption and eternal life be obtained. This is the core of the Christian faith and an important truth they need to know.

大乘佛教徒可能会对基督教的罪与救赎概念感到陌生或难以接受。需要耐心地解释所有人类因罪而堕落，且无法靠自身努力获得解脱。只有通过耶稣基督的恩典，才能获得真正的救赎和永生。这是基督教信仰的核心，也是他们所需要认识的重要真理。

## 8.  Base It On Prayer 

## 8. 以祷告为基础

When evangelizing, continuously pray for Mahāyāna Buddhists, asking the Holy Spirit to work in their hearts, so they may open up to know the truth of Jesus Christ. Prayer can also enhance your patience and wisdom in evangelism, enabling you to communicate in a gentle and effective manner.

传福音时，持续为大乘佛教徒祷告，求圣灵在他们心中工作，使他们敞开心扉，认识耶稣基督的真理。祷告也可以增强你在传福音中的耐心和智慧，使你能够以温和而有效的方式进行交流。

# Conclusion 

# 结论

Evangelizing to Mahāyāna Buddhists requires building relationships, finding common ground, and gently introducing the uniqueness of Jesus Christ, all based on a deep understanding of their doctrines and cultural background. Through personal testimony, joint discussion of the Bible, and continuous prayer, you can gradually guide them to recognize the truth of Jesus Christ as the only Savior. Evangelism is a long-term work; patience, wisdom, and God's guidance will be your most important tools.

向大乘佛教徒传福音需要在深入理解其教义和文化背景的基础上，建立关系、寻找共通点，并温和地介绍耶稣基督的独特性。通过个人见证、共同探讨《圣经》、以及持续的祷告，你可以逐步引导他们认识到耶稣基督作为唯一救主的真理。传福音是一项长期的工作，耐心、智慧和神的引导将是你最重要的工具。
