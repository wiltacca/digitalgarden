# A Chronology of Bible Events & World Events

The Timeline gives a visual overview of events in biblical times as compared to other famous world events. The timelines in the individual books of the Bible are different, focusing on the events occurring in the books themselves. This timeline gives the scope of biblical history from Creation to the resurrection of Christ and the beginnings of the church along with key events that were occurring in other parts of the world.
