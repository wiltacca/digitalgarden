# Why You Need To Understand KJV Personal Pronouns?

The King James Version of the Bible, translated in 1611, employs a pronoun system that differs significantly from modern English. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for proper interpretation of Scripture and recognising the precise meaning in each verse.
# What Is A Pronoun?

<font color="#de7802">Personal pronouns</font> (such as <font color="#de7802">I, you, ye, thou, thee</font>) refer to a person or a group of people.

# Why The KJV Pronouns Matter 

Matthew 4:3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. 4 But he answered and said, It is written Deut. 8:3, **Man shall not live by bread alone, but by<font color="#de7802"> every word </font>that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.**

# Why The KJV Pronouns Matter 

The English of our King James Bible (New Testament) is translated from Greek - which uses a <font color="#de7802">more precise </font>system of personal pronouns than we use in today's modern English;

💡The King James translators used the<font color="#de7802"> The Elizabethan Pronoun System</font> to reflect the same pronoun distinctions that are used in the biblical Greek;

# How Important Is This Distinction? 

✅ (KJV) John 3:7 Marvel not that I said unto <font color="#de7802">thee</font>, <font color="#de7802">Ye</font> must be born again.

❎ (NIV) John 3:7 <font color="#de7802">You</font> should not be surprised at my saying, '<font color="#de7802">You</font> must be born again.'

# All KJV Pronouns Are Either Singular or Plural

# All Pronouns Reflect A Point of View 

In the KJV Bible, the second-person pronouns (referring to "<font color="#de7802">you</font>") have distinct forms that differentiate between singular and plural addressees, as well as between subject, object, and possessive cases. 

This distinction, lost in modern English, provides greater precision in biblical interpretation.

| "Me"         | <font color="#de7802">"You"</font>                                                             | "Them"       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| First-person | <font color="#de7802">Second-person</font>                                                     | Third-person |
|              | <font color="#de7802">Thou, thee, thy, thine, ye and you are all second person pronouns</font> |              |

# Pronouns Have Subject and Object Forms 

💡<font color="#de7802">He</font> (<u>subject</u> performs action) is teaching <font color="#de7802">him</font> (<u>object</u> receives action).

💡<font color="#de7802">She</font> (<u>subject</u> performs action) is feeding <font color="#de7802">her</font> (<u>object</u> receives action).

✅ 1 Peter 1:15 But as he which hath called <font color="#de7802">you</font> (object receives action: we have received the call of God) is holy, so be <font color="#de7802">ye</font> (subject performs action: we are called to act holy) holy in all manner of conversation;

✅ Genesis 3:15 And I will put enmity between <font color="#de7802">thee</font> (object receives action) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and <font color="#de7802">thou</font> (subject performs action) shalt bruise his heel.

---
# Singular Pronouns (T-Forms)

💡The <u>singular second-person pronouns </u>begin with "<font color="#de7802">T</font>" and are used when addressing a <u>single</u> individual:

💡<font color="#de7802">Thou</font> - <u>subject</u> form (performs action)

Example: 
✅ "<font color="#de7802">Thou</font> (subject performs action) hast a sword." (You have a sword)

✅ "And <font color="#de7802">thou</font> (subject perform action) shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth.."

💡<font color="#de7802">Thee</font> - <u>object</u> form (receives action)

Example: 
✅ "The sword belongeth to <font color="#de7802">thee</font> (object receives action)." (The sword belongs to you)

✅ "Who gave <font color="#de7802">thee</font> (object receives action) this authority?" (Who gave you this authority)

---
# Plural Pronouns (Y-Forms)

💡The<u> plural second-person pronouns</u> begin with "<font color="#de7802">Y</font>" and are used when addressing <u>multiple</u> individuals:

💡<font color="#de7802">Ye </font>- <u>subject</u> form (performs action)

Example: 
✅ "<font color="#de7802">Ye</font> (subject performs action) have a kingdom."

✅ "If <font color="#de7802"> ye </font>(subject perform action) love me, keep my commandments."

💡<font color="#de7802">You</font> - <u>object</u> form (receives action)

Example: 
✅ "The kingdom belongeth to <font color="#de7802">you</font> (object receives action)."

✅ "...and he shall give <font color="#de7802">you</font> (object receives action) another Comforter, that he may abide with <font color="#de7802">you</font> (object receives action) for ever".

# Pronouns May Also Show Ownership (Possession) - My & Mine 

| Point of View | Subject Form | Object Form  | Possessive Form                       |
|:------------- |:------------ |:------------ |:------------------------------------- |
| 1st Person    | I            | Me           | <font color="#de7802">My, Mine</font> |
| 2nd Person    | Thou         | Thee         | Thy, Thine                            |
| 3rd Person    | He, she, it  | Him, her, it | His, hers, its                        |

💡"<font color="#de7802">My</font>" and "<font color="#de7802">mine</font>" are both used to show <u>ownership</u> (in the <u>first person point of view</u>). 

The difference between these words is similar to the difference between how we use "<font color="#de7802">a</font>" and "<font color="#de7802">an</font>." 

Write "<font color="#de7802">an</font>" before a word that begins with <u>vowel</u>, <font color="#de7802">a, e, i, o, u</font>. 

💡Similarly, "<font color="#de7802">mine</font>" is generally used before a word that begins with a <u>vowel</u>. 

💡Otherwise, "<font color="#de7802">my</font>" is used. 

For example: 
✅ Psalm 32:5 I acknowledged <font color="#de7802">my</font> (1st person possessive form) sin unto thee, and <font color="#de7802">mine</font> (1st person possessive form before a vowel) iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess <font color="#de7802">my</font> (1st person possessive form) transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of <font color="#de7802">my</font> (1st person possessive form) sin. Selah.

💡Otherwise, "<font color="#de7802">thy</font>" is used. 

For example: 
✅ Psalm 21:13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in <font color="#de7802">thine</font> (2nd person possessive form before a vowel) own strength: so will we sing and praise <font color="#de7802">thy</font> (2nd person possessive form) power.

# Practical Application In Scripture

The distinction between singular and plural forms in the KJV provides crucial interpretive clarity. 

✅ Consider Exodus 4:15: "And <font color="#de7802">thou</font> (singular subject) shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with <font color="#de7802">thy</font> (singular possessive) mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach <font color="#de7802">you</font> (plural object) what <font color="#de7802">ye</font> (plural subject) shall do."

In this verse, God addresses Moses individually with "<font color="#de7802">thou</font>" and "<font color="#de7802">thy</font>," but then shifts to "<font color="#de7802">you</font>" and "<font color="#de7802">ye</font>" when referring to both Moses and Aaron together. This nuance is lost in modern translations that use "<font color="#de7802">you</font>" for both singular and plural forms.

✅ Similarly, in John 14, Jesus moves from addressing Peter alone to addressing all His disciples: "Let not your heart be troubled: <font color="#de7802">ye</font> believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told <font color="#de7802">you</font>. I go to prepare a place for <font color="#de7802">you</font>."

The use of "<font color="#de7802">your</font>" (plural possessive) with "<font color="#de7802">heart</font>" (singular) indicates Jesus is addressing all disciples collectively as having one troubled heart, a subtlety lost in modern English translations.

# The Value of KJV Pronoun Distinctions

These pronoun distinctions in the KJV provide several benefits:
1. **Greater precision** in identifying whether individuals or groups are being addressed
2. **Clearer understanding** of pronoun antecedents in complex passages
3. **Insights into relationships** between speakers and addressees in Scripture
4. **Recognition of transitions** when a speaker shifts from addressing one person to addressing many

Unlike modern English that uses "<font color="#de7802">you</font>" for both singular and plural in all cases, the KJV's precision with pronouns allows readers to discern exactly who is being addressed in each verse, providing deeper insight into God's Word.

The careful attention to these pronoun forms reflects the KJV translators' commitment to accuracy and precision in rendering God's Word into English, preserving distinctions present in the original languages.
