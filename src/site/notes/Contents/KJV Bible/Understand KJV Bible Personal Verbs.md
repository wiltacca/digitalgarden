# Why You Need To Understand KJV Verbs?

The verb endings **“<font color="#de7802">-eth</font>”** and **“<font color="#de7802">-est</font>”** are distinctive features of Early Modern English, as used in the KJV. 

These suffixes are essential for understanding the structure and meaning of many KJV verses.

# The "-eth" Suffix

## **Function & Usage**

| Singular Forms: |              |
| :-------------- | :----------- |
| Point of View   | Subject Form |
| 3rd Person      | He, she, it  |

💡 **"<font color="#de7802">-eth</font>"** is a <u>third person singular present tense verb</u> ending.

💡It is used when the <u>subject</u> of the verb is **he, she, or it** (or a <u>singular noun</u>).

This ending corresponds to the modern English **“<font color="#de7802">-s</font>”** or **“<font color="#de7802">-es</font>”** (e.g., “he runs,” “she speaks”).

Examples:
✅ John 3:16: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever <font color="#de7802">believeth</font> in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

“<font color="#de7802">Believeth</font>” = “believes”

✅ Genesis 5:24:  And Enoch <font color="#de7802">walked</font> with God: and he _was_ not; for God took him.

“<font color="#de7802">Walked</font>” is past tense, but in other verses: “walketh” = “walks”

✅ Matthew 7:8: For every one that <font color="#de7802">asketh receiveth;</font> and he that <font color="#de7802">seeketh findeth</font>; and to him that <font color="#de7802">knocketh</font> it shall be opened.

 “<font color="#de7802">Asketh</font>” = “asks”; “<font color="#de7802">receiveth</font>” = “receives”; “<font color="#de7802">seeketh</font>” = “seeks”; “<font color="#de7802">findeth</font>” = “finds”; “<font color="#de7802">knocketh</font>” = “knocks”
 
### **Grammatical Rule**

⚠️The “-<font color="#de7802">eth</font>” ending is <font color="#ff0000">never</font> used for <u>first or second person subjects</u> (“<font color="#de7802">I</font>,” “<font color="#de7802">thou</font>,” “<font color="#de7802">we</font>,” “<font color="#de7802">ye</font>,” etc.).

⚠️ It is <font color="#ff0000">strictly</font> for <u>third person singular</u>.

# The "-est" Suffix

## **Function & Usage**

| Singular Forms: |              |
| :-------------- | :----------- |
| Point of View   | Subject Form |
| 2nd Person      | Thou         |

💡 **“<font color="#de7802">-est</font>”** is a <u>second person singular present tense verb </u>ending.

💡It is used when the <u>subject</u> is **“<font color="#de7802">thou</font>”** (you, <u>singular</u>).

⚠️ There is <font color="#ff0000">no direct equivalent in modern English</font>, as modern English uses “<font color="#de7802">you</font>” for both singular and plural and does not change the verb form.

Examples:
✅ John 13:6: Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, <font color="#de7802">dost</font> thou wash my feet?

"<font color="#de7802">dost</font>" (from "doest") is the second person singular present tense.

✅ Exodus 20:3: “Thou <font color="#de7802">shalt</font> have no other gods before me.”

**"<font color="#de7802">shalt</font>"** is the <u>future tense</u> of "<font color="#de7802">shall</font>" used <u>exclusively</u> with the second person singular pronoun"<font color="#de7802">thou</font>", this construction indicates a <u>future action</u> or a <u>command directed</u> specifically to one individual.

✅ John 21:17: “He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, <font color="#de7802">lovest</font> <font color="#de7802">thou</font> me?”

In contrast, the **"<font color="#de7802">-est</font>"** ending is the <u>present tense</u> verb ending used with "<font color="#de7802">thou</font>." It appears in verbs such as "<font color="#de7802">lovest</font>" (you love) or "<font color="#de7802">speakest</font>" "<font color="#de7802">knowest</font>".

### **Grammatical Rule**

**"<font color="#de7802">shalt</font>"** is the <u>future tense </u>form for "<font color="#de7802">thou</font>," while **"<font color="#de7802">-est</font>"** is the <u>present tense</u> ending for "<font color="#de7802">thou</font>," and both serve to make the <u>subject</u> and <u>tense</u> clear in the KJV, preserving the personal and direct nature of the address. 

⚠️ This ending is <font color="#ff0000">unique</font> to Early Modern English and is not found in modern usage.

# **Common Verb Forms**

Here is a table of common verb forms and their corresponding KJV English endings, with examples from Scripture:

| Verb (Infinitive) | 2nd Person Singular (with "thou") | 3rd Person Singular (with "he/she/it") | Plural (with "ye/they") | Example Verse (KJV)                                                                                                        |

| will (want)       | wilt                              | will                                   | will                    | "If thou **wilt**..." Matt 8:2; "He **will** deliver thee" Psalm 50:15; "Ye **will** not come..." John 5:40                |

| can               | canst                             | can                                    | can                     | "Thou **canst** make me clean" Matt 8:2; "He **can** have compassion" Heb 5:2; "Ye **can** discern the face..." Matt 16:3  |
| know              | knowest                           | knoweth                                | know                    | "Lord, thou **knowest** all things" John 21:17; "The Lord **knoweth** them..." 2 Tim 2:19; "Ye **know** not..." Mark 13:35 |

### **Grammatical Rule:**

💡The "<font color="#de7802">-est</font>" ending is for the <u>second person singular</u> ("<font color="#de7802">thou</font>").

💡The "<font color="#de7802">-eth</font>" ending is for the <u>third person singular </u>("<font color="#de7802">he/she/it</font>").

💡<font color="#de7802">Plural forms</font> use the base verb, as in modern English, with "<font color="#de7802">ye</font>" or "<font color="#de7802">they</font>" as the <u>subject</u>.

💡Some <font color="#de7802">irregular verbs</font> (such as "<font color="#de7802">be</font>" and "<font color="#de7802">have</font>") have <u>unique</u> forms.

These forms are distinctive to the KJV and Early Modern English, and recognizing them aids in understanding the <u>subject</u> and <u>tense</u> of each verb in Scripture.

# Analysis of Scriptural Examples

Let us examine a passage with both endings:

✅ John 1:38:  Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and <font color="#de7802">saith</font> unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where <font color="#de7802">dwellest</font> thou?

"<font color="#de7802">saith</font>"= "says" (third person singular, "<font color="#de7802">-eth</font>" ending)
"<font color="#de7802">dwellest</font>" = "do you dwell" (second person singular, "<font color="#de7802">-est</font>" ending, addressed to "<font color="#de7802">thou</font>")

✅ Matthew 6:6:  But thou, when <font color="#de7802">thou</font> <font color="#de7802">prayest</font>, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and <font color="#de7802">thy</font> Father which <font color="#de7802">seeth</font> in secret shall reward thee openly.

“<font color="#de7802">thou</font> <font color="#de7802">prayest</font>” (second person singular, “<font color="#de7802">you pray</font>”)
"<font color="#de7802">seeth</font>"= "says" (third person singular, <font color="#de7802">"-eth</font>" ending)

✅ John 1:42: And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, <font color="#de7802">Thou</font> <font color="#de7802">art</font> Simon the son of Jona: <font color="#de7802">thou</font> <font color="#de7802">shalt</font> be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.

"<font color="#de7802">Thou art</font>" = "are" (second person singular, present tense)
**"<font color="#de7802">shalt</font>"** is the <u>future tense</u> of "<font color="#de7802">shall</font>" used <u>exclusively</u> with the second person singular pronoun "<font color="#de7802">thou</font>", this construction indicates a <u>future action</u> or a <u>command directed</u> specifically to one individual.

# Theological &  Interpretive Significance

The use of **“<font color="#de7802">-eth</font>”** and **“<font color="#de7802">-est</font>”** in the KJV is not merely archaic but serves to:
1. **Clarify the subject** (singular vs. plural, second vs. third person)
2. **Preserve distinctions** found in the original Hebrew and Greek texts
3. **Convey reverence and formality** in addressing God and others

✅ For example, in **John 21:17**, Jesus asks Peter, “<font color="#de7802">Lovest</font> <font color="#de7802">thou</font> me?”—the use of “<font color="#de7802">lovest</font>” and “<font color="#de7802">thou</font>” makes the question deeply personal and direct.

# The Value of KJV Verbs Distinctions

The verb endings **“<font color="#de7802">-eth</font>”** and **“<font color="#de7802">-est</font>”** in the King James Version are essential grammatical markers:
<u></u>
💡 **“<font color="#de7802">-eth</font>”**:<u>Third person singular present tense</u> (he/she/it believes)

💡 **“<font color="#de7802">-est</font>”**: <u>Second person singular present tense</u> (thou believest)

Understanding these endings allows for a more precise reading of the KJV Bible, helping the reader discern the subject and the intended recipient of each statement. 

This precision reflects the translators’ commitment to faithfully rendering the original languages into English, maintaining both accuracy and reverence in the text.
