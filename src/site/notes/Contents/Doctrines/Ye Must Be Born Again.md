# The Story of Nicodemus

John 3:1-8 is one of the central passages in all of Scripture regarding the doctrine of the **new birth** or **regeneration**.

> [!bible]+ [John 3:1-8 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3:1-8&version=kjv)
> 1. There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
> 2. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
> 3. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
> 4. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
> 5. Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
> 6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
> 7. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
> 8. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

## John 3:1 – "There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:"

**Nicodemus** is identified as a **Pharisee** that is a sect known for its strict observance of the law and religious traditions.

He is also a **"ruler of the Jews"**, who is a member of the Sanhedrin, the highest Jewish council.

💡**Insight:** His status signifies deep religious training and high moral discipline. Yet, as the passage unfolds, it is clear that even this does not guarantee entrance into the Kingdom of God.

## John 3:2 – "The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him."

Nicodemus comes **by night**-possibly out of caution, or seeking privacy for spiritual inquiry.

He addresses Jesus as **"Rabbi"** (teacher), acknowledging His authority and the divine source of His miracles cf. Acts 2:22.

💡**Insight:** Nicodemus recognizes Jesus’ divine commission but does not yet understand His mission.

## John 3:3 – "Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."

**"Verily, verily"** (truly, truly)-Jesus introduces a foundational truth.

**"Born again"** (Greek: gennēthē anōthen) means **born from above**-a spiritual rebirth.

⚠️ **"Cannot see the kingdom of God"**- no amount of religious effort grants spiritual sight or entrance to God’s rule and blessing.

## John 3:4 – "Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"

Nicodemus misunderstands Jesus, thinking of a **physical rebirth**.

💡**Insight:** His question illustrates the inability of the natural mind to grasp spiritual truths without illumination 1 Corinthians 2:14.

## John 3:5 – "Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."

**"Born of water and of the Spirit"**:

_Water_: Traditionally understood in at least two ways:

1. **Physical birth** (natural birth involves water; the "water" of the womb).
2. **Spiritual cleansing** via the Word of God Ephesians 5:26 - "washing of water by the word"; cf. Ezekiel 36:25-27.

**"Born...of the Spirit"**: Regeneration by the Holy Ghost.

 ⚠️ **"Cannot enter"** is a repeated emphasis: no spiritual entry apart from the new birth.

## John 3:6 – "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."

**"Born of the flesh"**: Natural birth produces only natural life, incapable of reaching God Romans 8:7-8.

💡 **"Born of the Spirit"**: Only the Holy Spirit imparts spiritual life-eternal, heavenly, and godlike.

## John 3:7 – "Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again."

**"Marvel not"**: Jesus corrects Nicodemus' astonishment, this truth is essential for all, including Israel’s teachers.

💡 **"Ye must be born again"**: This is a universal requirement with no exceptions for status, religious background, or good works.

## John 3:8 – "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit."

Jesus compares the work of the Spirit to the **wind**:

**Invisible, sovereign, and mysterious**-wind cannot be controlled or fully understood, but its effects are seen and heard.

**So it is with the new birth:** The Spirit moves where He wills cf. 1 Corinthians 12:11, producing real change though the process is beyond human comprehension.

# What The New Birth Is NOT

The concept of the **new birth**-or being “born again”-is a central teaching of Jesus Christ, and it is crucial to properly distinguish between what the new birth **is** and what it **is not**. The new birth is the supernatural act by which one receives eternal life and is made a child of God, not by works or religious activities, but by faith through the operation of the Holy Spirit. Let us examine, in detail and with the scriptural support, why outward religious practices do not and cannot produce the new birth.

## ❌ **Church Membership**

**John 3:1-10** details the encounter between Jesus and Nicodemus who is a deeply religious man, a ruler of the Jews, and a member of the Pharisees.

**Nicodemus** was already an esteemed leader, yet Jesus insisted, “Ye must be born again” (v.7).

💡**Point:** Simply belonging to a religious community, even one as esteemed as the Jewish ruling council-does not produce spiritual birth.

## ❌ **Attendance at Worship Services**

**Regular worship** is commendable and expected of believers Hebrews 10:25: “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together…”, but mere attendance cannot impart spiritual life.

Many Jews faithfully attended synagogue, observed feasts, yet lacked a personal relationship with God.

✅ **Example:** **Isaiah 1:13-15:** Israel observed God’s outward ordinances, but God rejected their worship because their hearts were far from Him.

## ❌ **Rule-Keeping & Good Works**

**Rule-keeping, charity, and religious devotion** are often mistaken for saving faith.

The Pharisees were meticulous about the Law, tithing, and acts of piety Matthew 23:23, but Jesus repeatedly showed they were not born again Matthew 23:27.

**Paul’s Testimony:** **Philippians 3:4-7:** Paul lists his religious credentials, then says, “But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.”

**Scriptural Teaching:** **Romans 3:20:** “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight…”

## ❌ **Acts of Devotion, Bible Reading, Prayer, Humility, Sincerity**

**All these are spiritually profitable**-for the born-again believer.

**However:** One can read, memorize, and even teach the Bible and yet not be born again John 5:39-40.

✅ **Example:** 
Saul of Tarsus (Paul) was zealous in devotion-praying, fasting, studying the law, but did not know Christ until his conversion Acts 9:1-6.

**John 5:39-40:** “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.”

**Many people pray sincerely, yet do not have the new birth:** Matthew 6:7 – “But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do…”

## ❌ **Sacraments & Religious Rites (Including Baptism & Communion)**

**Baptism and the Lord’s Supper** are ordinances commanded of believers as expressions of faith, not as means of imparting spiritual life.

**Simon Magus** Acts 8:13, Acts 8:20-23 was baptized but not converted.

**The Apostle Paul:** “Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel...” 1 Corinthians 1:17.

⚠️ **Warning:** **1 Corinthians 11:27-29:** Partaking of the Lord’s supper unworthily brings judgment, not salvation.

## ❌ **Sacrificial Service**

 **Even giving one’s body to be burned** or giving all one’s goods to the poor does not profit, apart from genuine love and new birth 1 Corinthians 13:3.

 **Missionaries, preachers, and martyrs** can engage in these activities without having been born again Matthew 7:22.

## ❗**Scriptural Foundation: Justification by Faith, Not Works**

**Romans 3:28:** “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.”

**Ephesians 2:8-9:** “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”

💡**Key Point:** Salvation is a gift of God, received by faith, not something earned or merited by human effort, religious activity, or moral achievement.

# The Essential Nature & Means of The New Birth

## ✔️ **A Spiritual Birth**

John 3:6-7, Jesus explains: "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again."  This is not a change of behavior, but a supernatural work of God in the heart.

## ✔️ **By the Word & the Spirit**

"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." John 3:5.

**Water** here is generally understood as a reference to the cleansing power of the Word Ephesians 5:26; 1 Peter 1:23, or possibly a symbol of spiritual renewal.

**Spirit** refers to the Holy Ghost's operation in regeneration.

## ✔️ **By Faith in Christ Alone**

John 3:16, Jesus clarifies how this new birth takes place: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever <font color="#de7802">believeth in him</font> (see further explanation) should not perish, but have everlasting life."  

**To be born again is to place one’s trust, by faith, in the finished work of Jesus Christ, appropriating His sacrifice as one’s own, and receiving the new life imparted by the Spirit.**

---
## **What Does “Believeth in Him” Mean?**

## 1. **Faith Defined Biblically**

To **believe in Christ** is not merely to acknowledge his existence or agree with facts about Him. 

In the biblical sense, “believeth in him” (Greek: pisteuō eis auton) means:  **Personal trust** in Jesus as Saviour, **depending** on Christ’s finished work for salvation and **receiving** Jesus Christ personally by faith.

John 1:12:  “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:”

## 2. **Not Mere Intellectual Assent**

Many may **agree** that Jesus is the Son of God or even admire His teachings, but biblical faith goes further.

**James 2:19:**  “Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.”  (Even demons acknowledge facts about God, but they are not saved.)

## 3. **Trusting in Christ Alone**

Faith in this context excludes all human effort, religious works, or personal merit.

**Acts 16:31** – “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved…”

**Romans 3:22** – “Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference.

To believe is to **rest your eternal hope fully** on Christ’s sacrifice and resurrection, trusting that He alone can save.

## 4. **An Ongoing Faith**

The KJV’s “believeth” (present participle) means **continues to believe**-not a one-time decision, but an enduring, living faith that looks to Christ daily.

**John 6:35** – “He that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.”

**1 John 5:12-13** – “He that hath the Son hath life…”

## 5. **Union With Christ**

To “believe in Him” means to be united with Christ-sharing in His life, death, and resurrection spiritually.

**Galatians 2:20** – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”

## 6. **Results of True Faith**

**To “believe in Him” results in:** The forgiveness of sins Acts 10:43 – “that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.”

1. Becoming a child of God John 1:12
2. The indwelling of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 1:13
3. Assurance of everlasting life John 3:16; John 5:24

### Key Cross-References:

John 1:12–13: _“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.”_

1 Peter 1:23: _“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”_

Ephesians 2:8–9: _“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”_

# How To Check Whether Or Not I Am Truly Born Again?

## **Spiritual, Not Physical Birth**

**John 3:6:** _That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”_

**Physical birth** yields human life-our natural existence, tainted by the fall and inherited sin Romans 5:12.

**Spiritual birth** is a supernatural act in which the **Holy Ghost imparts new, spiritual life** John 1:12-13.

## **Not a Renovation-but a Regeneration**

The new birth is not God improving the old sinful nature, but imparting an entirely **new nature**.

**2 Corinthians 5:17:** _“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”_

## **The Holy Spirit’s Work**

**John 3:8:** The Spirit’s work is mysterious like the wind: visible by its effects, but invisible in operation.

**Titus 3:5:** _“Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;”_

The Spirit convicts of sin John 16:8, imparts life Romans 8:2, dwells within Romans 8:9, and seals Ephesians 1:13.

## **Key Areas of Change in the New Birth**

## ✔️**Change of Nature**

Prior to the new birth, man’s nature is selfish, sinful, and at enmity with God Romans 8:7.

**2 Peter 1:4:**  _“That by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature…”_

The new nature wants to please God, serve others, and pursue righteousness Ephesians 4:24.

## ✔️**Change of Heart**

The heart is the seat of affections.

**Ezekiel 36:26:**  _“A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you…”_

The indwelling Spirit purifies the heart Acts 15:9, making it a temple for God 1 Corinthians 6:19-20.

## ✔️**Change of Will**

Once self-willed and stubborn, the reborn person submits to God’s will.

**Philippians 2:13:**  _“For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”_

## ✔️**Change of Outlook**

The natural man is earth-bound, focused on temporal gain.
 
The reborn man is “heavenly minded” Colossians 3:1-2:  _“Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.”_

## ✔️**Change of Ambition**

Whereas formerly ambition was self-centered, now it is centered on God’s kingdom and gospel.

**Philippians 1:21:** _“For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.”_

## ✔️**Change of Desires**
 
 A desire to imitate Christ 1 John 2:6, to be holy 1 Peter 1:15-16, and to exalt Him.

 **Psalm 42:1:**  _“As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.”_

## ✔️**Change of Goal**

The ultimate aim is no longer self-advancement but the glory of God and the advancement of His kingdom Matthew 6:33.

## **Not Merely Psychological or Mental**

The Bible does not limit the new birth to a change in thinking or emotional state, though these will be affected.

It is a **radical, supernatural event**-a resurrection from spiritual death to spiritual life Ephesians 2:1-5.

## Historical Context & Theological Implications

In first-century Judaism, especially among the Pharisees, righteousness was viewed in terms of strict adherence to the Law and religious rituals. Many believed that birth as a Jew and faithful observance of the law ensured favor with God. Christ shattered this presumption, teaching the absolute necessity of personal, spiritual regeneration. 

Nicodemus, despite his high religious standing, needed the new birth-a spiritual transformation by the Holy Ghost. This is not a result of human effort, religious ceremony, or social status. Jesus’ teaching obliterates the idea that salvation can be earned or inherited.

**Church membership, regular worship, moral living, acts of devotion, and participation in sacraments have value only as responses to the new birth, NEVER as the means by which the new birth is received.** The new birth is the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit, received through faith in Jesus Christ alone, apart from works. It is the foundation upon which all true Christian living and service is built John 1:12-13; Titus 3:5.

Faithful attendance at worship, rule-keeping, charity, acts of devotion, Bible reading, prayer, humility, sincerity, sacraments, or even sacrificial service, these may accompany or flow from new birth, but **none of them produce it**. This is consistent with the teachings of Christ throughout the Gospels, and with Paul’s doctrine of justification by faith apart from works Romans 3:28; Ephesians 2:8-9.

**John 3:1-8 teaches that no amount of religion, morality, or human effort can bring a soul into the Kingdom of God. Only by the miraculous work of the Holy Spirit-being "born again"-is one granted spiritual life and entrance into God’s family. This is the heart of the gospel and the foundation of all true Christian faith.**

**Regeneration as a distinct work:** The Jews thought being born Abraham’s children was sufficient John 8:33-3, but Jesus requires new birth by the Spirit.

**The new birth is a sovereign work of God:** While men can see the evidence, they cannot control or explain the mystery.

**This doctrine underlies Jesus’ gospel:** Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, by the operation of the Spirit Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5.

**Irresistible, sovereign grace:** The wind blows “where it listeth” John 3:8-salvation is God’s initiative, not man's John 1:13.

---
## **Conclusion**

**To be “born of the Spirit” is to experience a complete, supernatural transformation of one’s inner being** wrought by the Holy Ghost through faith in Jesus Christ.

It is not a mere change of habits or outlook but the impartation of new life, new desires, and new affections.

Outward religion, mental resolve, or moral reformation cannot substitute for this spiritual rebirth.

Let every soul heed this solemn command, recognizing that salvation is God’s free gift, received by faith alone in Christ alone, resulting in a new creation.
